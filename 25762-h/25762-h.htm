<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>LOST</h3>
</div>

<p>Splash! went a big drop just on the exact tip of
Laura Jordon&#8217;s pretty, rather upturned nose. She
put her hand to the drop to be sure she had not been
mistaken, then turned in dismay to her companions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it&#8217;s raining!&#8221;
</p>
<p>If she had said the world was coming to an end
her companions could not have looked more startled.
Then Billie Bradley cocked an eye at what she could
see of the sky through the trees and held out one
hand experimentally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; she announced, turning an accusing
eye upon Laura. &#8220;It&#8217;s no more raining than
you are. And, anyway, haven&#8217;t we troubles enough
without your going and making up a new one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;M-making up!&#8221; Laura stuttered in her indignation.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe me, just look at my
nose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what your nose has to do with it,&#8221;
Billie began scornfully, but the third of the trio,
Violet Farrington, by name, interrupted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura&#8217;s right,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I just felt a great
big drop myself. Now, what ever are we going to
do?&#8221; Vi dropped down in a pathetic little heap on
a convenient rock, looking up at her chums wistfully.
</p>
<p>Violet Farrington was always a little wistful
when in trouble, like a small girl who can never understand
why she is being punished. But just now
this wistfulness irritated Billie Bradley, who was
very much given to quick action herself, and she
turned upon Vi rather snappily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t just sit there like a ninny,&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Get up and help us think what we can
do to get out of this mess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mess is right,&#8221; said Laura Jordon gloomily.
</p>
<p>And it must be admitted that the girls were in
rather a trying situation. Their botany teacher at
Three Towers Hall, where they were students, had
sent them into the woods to gather some rare ferns
which they were to use in the botany class the next
day.
</p>
<p>That was all very well; for if there was anything
the girls loved it was a trip into the woods. They
had started off in hilarious spirits; and then&mdash;the
impossible thing had happened.
</p>
<p>They had gathered the ferns, turned to go back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
to Three Towers, and found, to their absolute dismay,
that they did not know which way to go. There
was no getting over the fact. They were absolutely
and completely lost!
</p>
<p>For almost an hour now they had been wandering
around and around, getting deeper into the woods
every minute, until they had finally begun to feel
really frightened. Suppose they couldn&#8217;t find Three
Towers before dusk? Suppose they should be
forced to stay in the woods all night? These and a
hundred other thoughts had chased themselves
through their heads, but they had said nothing of
their fears to each other. The girls were thoroughly
&#8220;game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But now had come this new complication. It had
begun to rain. Hopelessly lost in the woods and a
storm coming on! It was a situation to try the patience
of a saint. And the girls were not saints.
They were just happy, fun-loving, lovable specimens
of young American girlhood who could upon
occasion show rather alarming flashes of temper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a ninny,&#8221; Vi protested hotly; but Billie
was already started on a different train of thought.
She caught Vi&#8217;s wrist in hers and her eyes were big
and round as she looked from her to Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; she said in a whisper, &#8220;we should
meet the Codfish!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Vi shivered nervously, but it was Laura&#8217;s turn
to be cross.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that
the Codfish is safe in jail, and has been there for a
long time? Now who&#8217;s making up something to
worry about, I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But thieves do break out of jail,&#8221; Billie insisted.
&#8220;And the Codfish is just the kind who would do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, Billie, what an idea!&#8221; said Vi breathlessly.
&#8220;I never even thought about his escaping.
And I suppose,&#8221; she added, beginning to feel deliciously
goose-fleshy, &#8220;that we&#8217;d be the very first
ones he&#8217;d go for. Revenge, you know&mdash;that&#8217;s what
they are always after in the stories.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to interrupt you,&#8221; Laura broke in as sarcastically
as she could. &#8220;But if you two want to
stand there all day talking about the Codfish and
revenge, you can, but I&#8217;m going to find some way
out of this place. Goodness, I felt another drop.
And there&#8217;s another!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t count them,&#8221; Billie remarked
briskly, bringing an hysterical giggle from Vi.
&#8220;Come on, there must be a path of some kind around
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there is, but if we can&#8217;t find it, it
won&#8217;t do us much good,&#8221; said Laura, looking about
her helplessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we certainly won&#8217;t find it by standing
still,&#8221; snapped Billie. &#8220;Come on. I feel it in my
bones that Three Towers is somewhere off in this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
direction.&#8221; And she led the way into the woods,
the girls following dispiritedly.
</p>
<p>And while the three chums are searching for the
path, the opportunity will be taken to recount to new
readers some of the adventures and queer experiences
the girls had had up to the present time.
</p>
<p>In the first book of this series, entitled, &#8220;Billie
Bradley and Her Inheritance,&#8221; Billie had been left
an old homestead at Cherry Corners in the upper
part of New York State. The strange legacy had
come to Billie from an eccentric aunt, Beatrice Powerson,
for whom Billie had been named. For Billie&#8217;s
real name was not Billie at all, but Beatrice.
</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the girls had decided
to spend their vacation there, and that the boys,
Billie&#8217;s brother Chetwood, Laura&#8217;s brother Teddy,
and another boy, Ferd Stowing, had joined them
there and that queer and exciting adventures had
followed.
</p>
<p>The most wonderful thing of all had been the
finding of the shabby old trunk in the attic whose
contents of rare old coins and postage stamps had
brought Billie in nearly five thousand dollars in cash.
The money had enabled Billie to replace a statue
which she had accidentally broken a little while before
and had also given her the chance to go to
Three Towers Hall, a good boarding school, and
Chet the opportunity to go to the Boxton Military
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Academy, which was only a little over a mile from
Three Towers Hall.
</p>
<p>The good times the girls had at school&mdash;and
some bad times, too&mdash;have been told of in the second
book of the series, called, &#8220;Billie Bradley at
Three Towers Hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In North Bend, where the girls had always lived,
there lived also two other girls, Amanda Peabody
and Eliza Dilks. These girls were sneaks and tattletales
of the worst order and were thoroughly disliked
by all the girls and boys with whom they had
come in contact.
</p>
<p>When the chums had heard that Amanda was to
accompany them to Three Towers they were absolutely
dismayed, for they expected that she would
spoil all the fun. Amanda had done her best to
live up to the expectations of the girls, but try as she
would, she had not been able to spoil entirely the
fun. And this very failure had, of course, made
her and her chum, Eliza Dilks, furious.
</p>
<p>Both Three Towers Hall and Boxton Military
Academy had been built on the banks of the beautiful
Lake Molata, and the girls and boys had spent
many happy hours rowing upon the lake in the
fall and skating upon it in the winter.
</p>
<p>But the most amazing thing that had happened
to them at Three Towers had been the capture of
the man the girls called &#8220;The Codfish.&#8221; This rascal
had attempted to steal Billie&#8217;s precious trunk in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
beginning, but Billie and the boys had given chase
in an automobile and had succeeded in recovering
the trunk. They had also succeeded in getting a
good look at the man, whose hair was red, eyes little
and close together, mouth wide and loose-lipped.
It was this last feature that had given the thief his
name with the boys and girls. For the mouth certainly
resembled that of a codfish.
</p>
<p>Later the &#8220;Codfish&#8221; had turned up again near
Three Towers Hall, had robbed one of the teachers
of her purse when she was returning from town,
and had later succeeded in making off with a great
many valuables from Boxton Military Academy.
</p>
<p>The girls never forgot how, with the aid of the
boys, they had captured the Codfish and turned him
over to the police. Though, as Laura said, the thief
had been in jail for some time, the chums had never
stopped thinking and wondering about him. But
never before had the possibility of his escaping been
thought of.
</p>
<p>But now, as they made their way through the
forest that was growing darker and darker, they
could not shake off the thought of him.
</p>
<p>They glanced often and uneasily into the shadowy
woodland and drew closer together as if for protection.
The rain was beginning to come a little
faster now, and their clothes felt damp. Even Billie&#8217;s
courage was beginning to fail.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>Suddenly Laura stopped stock still and looked at
them impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a bit of use our going on like this,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;For all we know we may be getting
farther away from the path every minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And my feet hurt,&#8221; added Vi pathetically.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Billie called to them. She had gone on
a little ahead and, peering through the dusk, had
seen the outline of something dark, a black smudge
against the gray of the woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, come here quick!&#8221; she cried, and half-fearing,
half-hoping, they knew not what, the others
ran to her.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE HUT IN THE WOODS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Laura cried.
</p>
<p>For answer Billie pointed through the gloom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There! See it?&#8221; she cried excitedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s some
sort of little house, I guess&mdash;a hut or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A house!&#8221; cried Laura joyfully. &#8220;Glory be, let&#8217;s
go! What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she asked, as the other
girls hung back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not be in too much of a hurry,&#8221; Billie
cautioned her. &#8220;The place looks as if it were
empty; but you never can tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s something I can tell,&#8221; Laura retorted
impatiently. &#8220;And that is, that I&#8217;m getting
soaking wet.&#8221; She started on again, but Billie
called to her to stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be crazy, Laura,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;We&#8217;re
all alone in the woods, and it&#8217;s almost night. How
do we know who may be in that shack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billie, suppose it were the Codfish!&#8221; whispered
Vi, and Laura looked disgusted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t apt to be the Codfish,&#8221; returned Billie.
&#8220;But whoever it is, I think we&#8217;d better be careful.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
We&#8217;ll go up to it softly and look about a bit. Please
don&#8217;t any one speak until we&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls were used to obeying Billie, even impulsive
Laura, so now they followed softly at her
heels, stepping over twigs so as to make no noise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! anybody would think we were thieves
ourselves,&#8221; Laura giggled hysterically, and Billie
looked back at her warningly.
</p>
<p>It was a strange thing and strangely made, this
remote little shelter in the woods. It probably had
some sort of framework of wood inside, but all
the girls could see from the outside was a rude
structure entirely covered by moss and interwoven
twigs. In fact, unless one looked closely, one might
think that the little hut was no hut at all, but part
of the foliage itself.
</p>
<p>The girls could find no windows, but as they
moved cautiously around the hut Billie came upon
a small door. The latter was hardly more than four
feet high, and the girls would have to stoop considerably
to get through it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness sake, open it, Billie,&#8221; Laura whispered
close in her ear. &#8220;It&#8217;s beginning to pour
pitchforks and I&#8217;m getting soaking wet. I don&#8217;t
care if a hyena lives in there, I&#8217;m going in too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie wanted to laugh, but she was too wet and
nervous. So she opened the little door cautiously
and peered inside.
</p>
<p>For a minute she could not tell whether the hut
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
was empty or not, for it was very very dark. But
as her eyes became accustomed to the darkness she
felt sure that the place was empty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; she called over her shoulder to the
girls, her voice still cautiously lowered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
see very well, but I guess there&#8217;s nobody at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls had to stoop almost double to enter the
tiny door, but once inside they were surprised to
find that they could stand upright.
</p>
<p>They were in almost entire darkness, the only
patch of light coming from the little door that Vi
had left open. Suddenly they began to feel panicky
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only get a light,&#8221; whispered Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, listen to the child,&#8221; said Laura scornfully.
&#8220;She wants all the comforts of home&mdash;ouch!&#8221;
Her toe had come in contact with something hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried Billie startled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter enough,&#8221; moaned Laura. &#8220;I&#8217;ve broken
my toe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well, if that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Billie, but Laura began
to laugh hysterically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I only wish it
had happened to you, Billie Bradley!&#8221;
</p>
<p>If all wishes could be fulfilled as quickly as that
of Laura&#8217;s there would be few unsatisfied people
in the world, for before it was out of her mouth
Billie uttered a sharp cry of pain, and, lifting a
smarting ankle in her hand, began to rub it gently.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you do it, too?&#8221; cried Laura joyfully, adding
with a good imitation of Billie: &#8220;Oh well, if
that&#8217;s all&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh for goodness sake, keep still,&#8221; cried Billie,
from which it will be seen that Billie was not in
the best of tempers. &#8220;This place must be full of
stuff. Goodness, why didn&#8217;t we think to bring
matches with us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we went out to get ferns, not to burn
up the woods,&#8221; said Laura, with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; cried Vi suddenly out of the darkness.
&#8220;It is&mdash;no it isn&#8217;t&mdash;yes it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness sake, what&#8217;s the matter with her?&#8221;
asked Laura, getting hysterical again. &#8220;Has trouble
turned her head?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But something&#8217;s turned yours,&#8221; Vi&#8217;s voice
came indignantly back at her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found something,
I have. But I&#8217;ve a good mind not to tell
you what it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Violet, my darling,&#8221; cried Laura, fondly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see me on my knees?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Vi, and suddenly there was a flare
of light in the room that illuminated the faces
of the girls and made Billie and Laura jump.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you,&#8221; said Vi calmly, and stood laughing
at them while the flickering match in her hand died
down to a little glimmer and went out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what you found&mdash;matches,&#8221; cried Billie
joyfully, while Laura just kept on gaping. &#8220;Oh,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Vi, you&#8217;re a darling, and I forgive you for scaring
us almost to death. Come on, light another one so
we can see where we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Vi obediently lighted another match, a box of
which she had found quite by accident, and the girls
looked about them curiously. And as they looked
their curiosity and wonder grew. Billie was wild
with impatience when the match in Vi&#8217;s hand flickered
and went out again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, give them to me,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I thought I
saw something. Look out, don&#8217;t spill them, Vi!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not&mdash;they&#8217;re all we have,&#8221; chimed
in Laura.
</p>
<p>The match flared up in Billie&#8217;s hand, and this
time it was her turn to make a discovery. The discovery
was a pair of thick white candles, each set
in a white china dish and pushed to one end of
a rudely-made table.
</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, Billie put the match to the wick
of one candle, and then, with a sigh of excitement,
blew out the match that was almost burning her
fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she cried, looking about her eagerly,
&#8220;isn&#8217;t this the queerest, funniest little place you ever
saw? And it&#8217;s so complete.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Excitedly she crossed the little hut, whose floor
was nothing but solid, trampled-down earth, and began
to examine a rude-looking cot that ran along all
one side of the queer little place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s a pantry!&#8221; exclaimed Vi excitedly.
&#8220;Look, girls, shelves and cans of things and&mdash;and&mdash;everything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The interior of the place was made of rough
boards, rudely thrown together as if by an amateur.
Why the person who had made the little cabin had
not laid boards for his floor, nobody could tell. Perhaps
he had run short of lumber or perhaps he preferred
the hard earth floor.
</p>
<p>As Vi had said, in one corner some boards had
been nailed up to form shelves, and there were several
tins of canned goods upon the shelves. Quite
evidently this must be the queer owner&#8217;s pantry.
</p>
<p>Besides this, the cot, the table, and an oddly-shaped
chair, which had evidently been made from
an old soap box, made the only furnishings of the
place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Billie, looking about her while
a sort of awe crept into her voice, &#8220;what the person
is like that lives here. He must be very queer, to
say the least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Vi, all her old fears coming back
again. &#8220;Girls, I&#8217;d almost forgotten the Codfish. Do
you suppose&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Laura shortly, wishing that
the very mention of the Codfish would not send the
cold chills all over her. &#8220;Goodness, just listen to
that rain,&#8221; she added, shivering. &#8220;I guess we&#8217;re in
for a night of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t stay <i>here</i> all night,&#8221; said Billie
anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose the owner should come back,&#8221; added
Vi, her teeth beginning to chatter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he could only kill us if he did,&#8221; said Laura
gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, there are three of us to his one,&#8221; said
Billie, trying to speak lightly. But Laura spoiled
the attempt by adding more gloomily than ever:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we know there&#8217;s only one of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well it doesn&#8217;t look as if a whole family resided
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so too&mdash;but there may be two, at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the girls looked around the queer place.
They saw a few tools as if somebody had spent
time in woodworking. There were shavings and
parts of cut tree branches and strips of bark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager he&#8217;s a queer stick&mdash;whoever he is,&#8221;
was Billie&#8217;s comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what will he say if he finds us here, prying
into his private affairs?&#8221; came from Laura, with
something of a shiver. &#8220;Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>All uttered a little cry as a crash of thunder
reached them. Then the rain seemed to come down
harder than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just listen to that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good we are under cover. If we weren&#8217;t
we&#8217;d be drowned!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rain came in at one corner of the shelter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
forming a pool on the hard floor. But it did not
reach the girls, for which they were thankful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how long it will last,&#8221; sighed Vi presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe all night,&#8221; returned Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do you really think it will last that long?&#8221;
came pleadingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know as much about it as I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will they think of our absence at the Hall?&#8221;
broke in Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They may send out a searching party&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; cried Vi suddenly, and her tone sent
the gooseflesh all over them again. &#8220;I hear something.
Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better put something
against the door?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>FERNS AND MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Th-there&#8217;s nothing to put against the door,&#8221;
stammered Billie nervously. &#8220;I might put out the
light though.&#8221; She started for the candle, but
Laura put out a hand and stopped her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather see what&#8217;s after us,
anyway. I hate the dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The noise that Vi had heard was a slow measured
step that sounded to the girls&#8217; overwrought
nerves more like the stealthy creeping of an animal
than the tread of a man. But whoever or whatever
it was, it was coming steadily toward the hut&mdash;that
much was certain.
</p>
<p>The girls drew close together for protection and
watched the little door wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like a bear,&#8221; whispered Vi hysterically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silly,&#8221; Laura hissed back at her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know that bears don&#8217;t grow in this part of the country?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if it was a man,&#8221; Vi argued, &#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t
be walking so slowly&mdash;not in this kind of weather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; commanded Billie. &#8220;He&#8217;s almost here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the Codfish&mdash;&#8221; Vi was saying desperately,
when the little door opened and she clapped her
hand to her mouth, choking back the words.
</p>
<p>Some one was coming through the door, some
one who had to bend so much that for a startled
moment the girls were not at all sure but what it
was an animal, after all, and not a man that they
had to reckon with.
</p>
<p>Then the visitor stood up and they saw with real
relief that it was a man after all. As a matter of
fact, after the first startled minute it was the newcomer
who seemed frightened and the girls who
tried to make him feel at home.
</p>
<p>At first sight of the girls the man staggered backward
and came up with a thump against the wall
of the hut. From there he regarded them with
eyes that fairly bulged from his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls stared for a moment, then Laura giggled.
Who could be frightened when a person
wanted to know who they were?
</p>
<p>He was a queer looking man. He was tall, over
six feet, and so thin that the skin seemed to be
drawn over the bones. His shoulders slumped and
his arms hung loosely, whether from weariness or
discouragement or laziness, the girls found it impossible
to tell.
</p>
<p>But it was his eyes that they noticed even in
that moment of excitement. They were big, much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
too big for his thin face, and so dark that they
seemed deep-sunken. And the expression was
something that the girls remembered long afterward.
It was brooding, haunted, mysterious, with
a little touch of wildness that frightened the girls.
Yet his mouth was kind, very kind, and looking at
it, the girls ceased to be afraid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who <i>are</i> you?&#8221; the man repeated, and this time
Billie found her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we got lost,&#8221; she said hesitatingly, speaking
more to the kind mouth of the man than to the
strange, wild eyes. &#8220;It began to rain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we found this little place,&#8221; Laura caught
her up eagerly, &#8220;and came inside to keep from
drowning to death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; Vi finished, with her
pleading smile which sometimes won more than all
Billie&#8217;s and Laura&#8217;s courage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind,&#8221; the man repeated vaguely, passing a
hand across his eyes as if to wake himself up. &#8220;Why
should I mind? It isn&#8217;t very often I have company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls thought he spoke bitterly but the next
minute he smiled at them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t ask you to sit down,&#8221; he said,
so embarrassed that Billie took pity on him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to sit down,&#8221; she said, smiling
at him. &#8220;We&#8217;re too nervous. Do you suppose the
rain will ever stop?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>The man shook out his clothing and sent a shower
of spray all about him. He was soaking, drenching
wet, and suddenly, looking at him, Billie had
a dreadful thought.
</p>
<p>Suppose the man was not quite right in his mind?
She had a horror of crazy people. But what sane
man would build himself a cabin in the woods like
this in the first place, and then go roaming around
in the rain without any protection?
</p>
<p>A memory of the slow, measured steps they had
heard approaching the cabin made her shudder, and
instinctively she drew back a little and snuggled
her hand into Laura&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>If he was not crazy he was probably a criminal
of some sort, and neither thought made Billie feel
very comfortable. Three girls alone in the woods
with a crazy man or a criminal, with the darkness
coming on&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Something of what she was thinking occurred
to Laura and Vi also, and they were beginning to
look rather pale and scared.
</p>
<p>As for the man&mdash;he hardly seemed to know what
to do next. He took off his dripping coat, threw
it in a heap in one corner and turned back uncertainly
to the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it will stop raining for some
time,&#8221; he said, seeming to realize that Billie had
asked a question which he had not answered. &#8220;And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
it is getting pretty dark outside. You say you
are lost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Billie, wishing she had not told the
man that part of their troubles; but then, what else
could she do? &#8220;We were sent into the woods to
find rare ferns&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferns!&#8221; broke in the man, his deep eyes lighting
up with sudden interest. &#8220;Ah, I could show
you where the rarest and most beautiful ferns in
the country grow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could!&#8221; they cried, growing interested in
their turn and coming closer to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;a&mdash;naturalist?&#8221; asked Vi a little uncertainly,
for she knew just enough about naturalists
to be sure she was not one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you might call me that,&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to become one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the girls had that strange feeling of mystery
surrounding the man. He walked over to the
other end of the room and before the girls&#8217; amazed
eyes took out what they had thought to be part of
the table.
</p>
<p>It was a very cleverly hidden receptacle, and as
the girls looked down into it they saw that it was
half filled with curious little fern baskets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I make them,&#8221; the man explained, as they looked
up at him, puzzled. &#8220;And then I sell them in the
town&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mouth tightened bitterly, and he hastily returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the baskets to their hiding place. Then he
turned and faced them abruptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; he asked almost
sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We come from Three Towers Hall,&#8221; answered
Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three Towers!&#8221; The man looked very much
interested. &#8220;Are you&mdash;er&mdash;teachers there or pupils?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers! Hardly,&#8221; and Billie had to smile.
&#8220;We are not old enough for that. We are pupils.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like the place?'&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again there was a pause, and it must be admitted
that, for a reason they could not explain, the girls
felt far from comfortable. Oh, if only they were
back at the boarding school again!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a great deal about the school,&#8221;
said the man slowly. &#8220;I suppose there are lots of
girls there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over a hundred,&#8221; said Laura, thinking she should
say something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And quite a few teachers, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the man asked quite a lot of other questions
and the girls answered him as best they could.
The man continued to look at them so queerly that
Billie was convinced that there was something wrong
with him. But what was it? Oh, if only the storm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
would let up, so they could start back to the school!
</p>
<p>But even when the rain stopped, how could they
get back? They were lost, and at night the way
would be even harder to find than in the daytime.
</p>
<p>No, they were completely in this man&#8217;s power.
If he put them on the right path to Three Towers
all well and good. If not&mdash;&mdash;But she refused to
think of that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t raining hard any more,&#8221; Laura
broke in on her thoughts. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we
could go now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it hasn&#8217;t stopped raining we don&#8217;t
mind,&#8221; added Vi eagerly. &#8220;We&#8217;re wet now, and
we won&#8217;t mind being a little bit wetter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For an answer the man opened the door and
crawled out into the open. In a moment he was
back with what seemed to the girls the best news
they had ever heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rain is over,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the foliage is
still dripping. If you really don&#8217;t mind getting
wet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t!&#8221; they cried, and were starting
from the door when Vi suddenly remembered something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The ferns!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Where are they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls searched frantically about, knowing
that their botany teacher would reprimand them if
they did not bring back the ferns, and finally found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
them on the floor where somebody had brushed them
in the excitement.
</p>
<p>Then they crept out through the door, their
strange acquaintance lingering behind to put out the
light, and found themselves in the cool darkness of
the forest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he will really take us back?&#8221;
Vi whispered, close to Billie&#8217;s ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better!&#8221; said Billie, clenching her hands
fiercely against her side. &#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;murder
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, don&#8217;t talk of murder,&#8221; cried Laura
hysterically. &#8220;It&#8217;s an awful word to use in the
dark, and everything!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>AT THE SCHOOL AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one word worse,&#8221; said a gloomy
voice so close behind them that Vi clapped a hand
to her mouth to keep from crying out. &#8220;And that,&#8221;
the gloomy voice went on, &#8220;is <i>theft</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls never afterward knew what kept them
from breaking loose and running away. Probably
it was because they were paralyzed with fright.
</p>
<p>While they had thought the man was still in the
hut he had come softly up behind them and had
overheard the last, at any rate, of what they had
said. Billie, as usual, was the first to recover herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take us to Three Towers now?&#8221; she
asked in a voice that she hardly recognized as her
own. &#8220;Do you know the way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, adding moodily, as though
to himself: &#8220;Hugo Billings ought to know the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie caught at the name quickly, for she had
been wondering what this strange person called
himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hugo Billings!&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;Is that your
name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man had started on ahead of them through
the dark woods, but now he stopped and looked
back and Billie could almost feel his eyes boring
into her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say so?&#8221; he asked sharply, then just as
quickly turned away and started on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, I guess he must be a crazy criminal,&#8221;
thought Billie plaintively, as she and her chums followed
their leader, stumbling on over rocks and
roots that sometimes bruised their ankles painfully.
&#8220;I suppose there are some people that are both.
Anyway, he must be a criminal, or he wouldn&#8217;t
have been so mad about my knowing his name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of that strange journey seemed interminable.
There were times when the girls were sure
the man who called himself Hugo Billings was not
taking them toward Three Towers Hall at all. It
seemed impossible that they could have wandered
such a long way into the woods.
</p>
<p>Then suddenly their feet struck a hard-beaten
path and they almost cried aloud with relief. For
they recognized the path and knew that the open
road was not far off. Once on the open road, they
could find their way alone.
</p>
<p>Abruptly the man in front stopped and turned to
face them. Once more the girls&#8217; hearts misgave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
them. Was he going to make trouble after all?
Why didn&#8217;t he go on?
</p>
<p>And then the man spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go any farther with you,&#8221; he said, and
there was something in his manner of speaking that
made them see again in imagination the tired slump
of his shoulders, the wild, haunted look in his eyes.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the road. But you can find it easily
from here. Then turn to your right. Three Towers
is hardly half a mile up the road. Good night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned with abruptness and started back the
way they had come. But impulsively Billie ran to
him, calling to him to stop. Yet when he did stop
and turned to look at her she had not the slightest
idea in the world what she had intended to say&mdash;if
indeed she had really intended to say anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I just wanted to thank you,&#8221; she stammered,
adding, with a swift little feeling of pity for this
man who seemed so lonely: &#8220;And if there&#8217;s anything
I can ever do to&mdash;to&mdash;help you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you I needed help?&#8221; cried the man, his
voice so harsh and threatening that Billie started
back, half falling over a root.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why,&#8221; faltered Billie, saying almost the
first thing that came into her mind. &#8220;You looked
so&mdash;so&mdash;sad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sad,&#8221; the man repeated bitterly. &#8220;Yes, I have
enough to make me sad. But help!&#8221; he added
fiercely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need help from you or any one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>And without another word he turned and strode
off into the darkness.
</p>
<p>After that it did not take the girls long to reach
the road. They felt, someway, as if they must
have dreamed their adventure, it had all been so
strange and unreal. And yet they knew they had
never been more awake in their lives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t talk about it now,&#8221; begged Vi when
Laura would have discussed it. &#8220;Let&#8217;s wait till
we get in our dorm with lights and everything. I&#8217;m
just shivering all over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For once the others were willing to do as the
most timid of the trio wished, and they hurried
along in silence till they saw, with hearts full of
thankfulness, the lights of Three Towers Hall shine
out on the road before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, I see the lights!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness we haven&#8217;t much farther to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all of a quarter of a mile, Vi.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! what&#8217;s a quarter of a mile after such a
tramp as we have had?&#8221; came from Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And after such an experience,&#8221; added Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll certainly have some story to tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want something to eat first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and dry clothes, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a queer hut and what a queer man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of people being lost before,&#8221; said
Billie, as they ran up the steps that led to the handsomest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
door in the world, or at least so they thought
it at that moment. &#8220;But now I know that what
they said about it wasn&#8217;t half bad enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But not every one finds a hut and a funny man
when they get lost,&#8221; said Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t be so conceited about it,&#8221; said
Laura, pausing with her hand on the door knob.
&#8220;The girls probably won&#8217;t believe us when we tell
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Laura was wrong. The girls did really believe
the story of Hugo Billings and the hut and
became tremendously excited about it. At first they
were all for making up an expedition and going to
see it&mdash;the only drawback being that the chums
could not have directed them to it if they would.
</p>
<p>And they would not have wished to, anyway.
They had rather good reason to believe that Hugo
Billings would not want a lot of curious girls spying
about his quarters, and, being sorry for him
and grateful to him for helping them out of their
fix, they absolutely refused to have anything to do
with the idea.
</p>
<p>They were greeted with open arms on the night
of their return. Miss Walters, the much-beloved
head of Three Towers Hall, said that she had been
just about to send out a searching party for them.
</p>
<p>They were late for supper, but that only made
their appetites better, and as they were favorites
of the cook they were given an extra share of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
everything and ate ravenously, impatient of the
questions flung at them by the curious girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness the Dill Pickles aren&#8217;t here,&#8221;
Laura said to Billie between mouthfuls of pork
chop. &#8220;Think of coming home with <i>our</i> appetites
to the kind of dinners they used to serve us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura! what a horrible thought,&#8221; cried Billie,
her eyes dancing as she helped herself to two more
biscuits. &#8220;That&#8217;s treason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the &#8220;Dill Pickles&#8221; were two elderly spinsters
who had been teachers at Three Towers Hall when
Billie and her chums had first arrived. Their tartness
and strictness and miserliness had made the
life of the girls in the school uncomfortable for
some time.
</p>
<p>And then had come the climax. Miss Walters,
having been called away for a week or two, Miss
Ada Dill and Miss Cora Dill, disrespectfully
dubbed by the girls the twin &#8220;Dill Pickles,&#8221; had
things in their own hands and proceeded to make
the life of the girls unbearable. They had taken
away their liberty, and then had half starved them
by cutting down on the meals until finally the girls
had rebelled.
</p>
<p>With Billie in the lead, they had marched out of
Three Towers Hall one day, bag and baggage, to
stay in a hotel in the town of Molata until Miss
Walters should get back. Miss Walters, coming
home unexpectedly, had met the girls in town, accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
them back to Three Towers and, as one
of the girls slangily described it, &#8220;had given the
Dill Pickles all that was coming to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In other words, the Misses Dill had been discharged
and the girls had come off victorious. Now
there were two new teachers in their place who were
as different from the Dill Pickles as night is from
day. All the girls loved them, especially a Miss
Arbuckle who had succeeded Miss Cora Dill in
presiding over the dining hall.
</p>
<p>So it was to this that Laura had referred when
she said, &#8220;Thank goodness the Dill Pickles are
gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After they had eaten all they could possibly contain,
the girls retired to their dormitories, where
they changed their clothes, still damp from their
adventure, for comfortable, warm night gowns, and
held court, all the girls gathering in their dormitory
to hear of their adventures, for nearly an hour.
</p>
<p>At the end of that time the bell for &#8220;lights-out&#8221;
rang, and the chums found to their surprise that for
once they were not sorry. What with the adventure
itself and the number of questions they had
answered, they were tired out and longed for the
comfort of their beds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you suppose,&#8221; said Connie Danvers as
she rose to go into her dormitory, which was across
the hall, &#8220;that the man was really a little out of his
head?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was more than a little,&#8221; said Laura
decidedly, as she dipped her face into a bowl of
cold water. &#8220;I think he was just plain crazy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Connie Danvers was a very good friend of the
chums, and one of the most popular girls in Three
Towers Hall. Just now she looked a little worried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! first we have the Codfish,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and then you girls go and rake up a crazy man.
We&#8217;ll be having a menagerie next!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the spring of the year, a time when every
normal boy and girl becomes restless for new scenes,
new adventures. The girls at Three Towers Hall
heard the mysterious call and longed through hot
days of study to respond to it.
</p>
<p>The teachers felt the restlessness in the air and
strove to keep the girls to their lessons by making
them more interesting. But it was of no use. The
girls studied because they had to, not, except in a
few scattered cases, because they wanted to.
</p>
<p>One of the exceptions to the rule was Caroline
Brant, a natural student and a serious girl, who had
set herself the rather hopeless task of watching
over Billie Bradley and keeping her out of scrapes.
For Billie, with her love of adventure and excitement,
was forever getting into some sort of scrape.
</p>
<p>But these days it would have taken half a dozen
Caroline Brants to have kept Billie in the traces.
Billie was as wild as an unbroken colt, and just as
impatient of control. And Laura and Vi were almost
as bad.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>There was some excuse for the girls. In the first
place, the spring term at Three Towers Hall was
drawing to a close, and at the end of the spring
term came&mdash;freedom.
</p>
<p>But the thing that set their blood racing was the
thought of what was in store for them after they
had gained their freedom. Connie Danvers had
given the girls an invitation to visit during their
vacation her father&#8217;s bungalow on Lighthouse Island,
a romantic spot off the Maine coast.
</p>
<p>The prospect had appealed to the girls even in
the dead of winter; but now, with the sweet scent
of damp earth and flowering shrubs in the air, they
had all they could do to wait at all.
</p>
<p>The chums had written to their parents about
spending their vacation on the island, and the latter
had consented on one condition. And that condition
was that the girls should make a good record
for themselves at Three Towers Hall. And it is
greatly to be feared that it was only this unreasonable&mdash;to
the girls&mdash;condition that kept them at
their studies at all.
</p>
<p>It was Saturday morning, and Billie, all alone in
one of the study halls, was finishing her preparation
for Monday&#8217;s classes. She always got rid
of this task on Saturday morning, so as to have her
Saturday afternoon and Sunday free. She had
never succeeded in winning Laura and Vi over to
her method, so that on their part there was usually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
a wild scramble to prepare Monday&#8217;s lessons on
Sunday afternoon.
</p>
<p>As Billie, books in hand and a satisfied feeling in
her heart, came out of the study room, she very
nearly ran into Miss Arbuckle. Miss Arbuckle
seemed in a great hurry about something, and the
tip of her nose and her eyes were red as though
she had been crying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Billie, for Billie
was not at all tactful when any one was in
trouble. Her impulse was to jump in and help,
whether one really wanted her help or not. But
everybody that knew Billie forgave her her lack of
tact and loved her for the desire to help.
</p>
<p>So now Miss Arbuckle, after a moment of hesitation,
motioned Billie into the study room, and,
crossing over to one of the windows, stood looking
out, tapping with her fingers on the sill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost something, Billie,&#8221; she said, without
looking around. &#8220;It may not seem much to you
or to anybody else. But for me&mdash;well, I&#8217;d rather
have lost my right hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked around then, and Billie saw fresh
moisture in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked gently. &#8220;Perhaps I&mdash;we
can help you find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you could,&#8221; said Miss Arbuckle, with a
little sigh. &#8220;But that would be too good to be true.
It was only an old family album, Billie. But there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
were pictures in it that I prize above everything I
own. Oh, well,&#8221; she gave a little shrug of her
shoulders as if to end the matter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get over
it. I&#8217;ve had to get over worse things. But,&#8221; she
smiled and patted Billie&#8217;s shoulder fondly, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean to burden your young shoulders with my
troubles. Just run along and forget all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie did run along, but she most certainly did
not &#8220;forget all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny thing to get so upset about,&#8221; she said
to herself, as she slowly climbed the steps to her
dormitory. &#8220;A picture album! I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d
ever get my nose and eyes all red over one. Just
the same, I&#8217;d like to find it and give it back to her.
Good Miss Arbuckle! After the Dill Pickles, she
seems like an angel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was still smiling over the thought of what
had happened to the Dill Pickles when she opened
the door of the dormitory and came upon her
chums.
</p>
<p>Laura and Vi and a dark-haired, pink-cheeked
girl were sitting on one of the beds in one corner
of the dormitory, alternately talking and gazing
dreamily out of the window to Lake Molata, where
it gleamed and shimmered in the morning sunlight
at the end of a sloping lawn.
</p>
<p>The dark-haired, pink-cheeked girl was Rose
Belser. Rose Belser, being jealous of Billie&#8217;s immense
popularity at Three Towers Hall the term
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
before, had done her best to get the new girl into
trouble, only to be won over to Billie&#8217;s side in the
end. Now she was as firm a friend of Billie&#8217;s as
any girl in Three Towers Hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; was Laura&#8217;s greeting as Billie sauntered
toward them. &#8220;Methinks &#8217;tis time you arrived,
sweet damsel. Goodness!&#8221; she added, dropping her
lazy tone and sitting up with a bounce, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
why you have to go and spoil the whole morning
with your beastly old studying. Think of the fun
we could have had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but think of the fun we&#8217;re going to have
this afternoon,&#8221; Billie flung back airily, stopping
before the mirror to tuck some wisps of hair into
place, while the girls, even Rose, who was as pretty
as a picture herself, watched her admiringly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
almost lunch time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to tell us that,&#8221; said Vi in an
aggrieved tone. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we been waiting for you
all morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come on,&#8221; said Billie, as the lunch gong
sounded invitingly through the hall. &#8220;Maybe when
you&#8217;ve had something to eat you&#8217;ll feel better. Feed
the beast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, she&#8217;s calling us names again,&#8221; cried Laura,
making a dive for Billie. But Billie was already
flying down the steps two at a time, and when
Billie once got a head start, no one, at least no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
one in Three Towers Hall, had a chance of catching
up with her.
</p>
<p>It seemed to be Billie&#8217;s day for bumping into people&mdash;for
at the foot of the stairs she had to clutch
the banister to keep from colliding with Miss Walters,
the beautiful and much loved head of the
school.
</p>
<p>At Billie&#8217;s sudden appearance the latter seemed
inclined to be alarmed, then her eyes twinkled, and
as she looked at Billie she chuckled, yes, actually
chuckled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beatrice Bradley,&#8221; she said, with a shake of her
head as she passed on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my best with you,
but it&#8217;s of no use. You&#8217;re utterly incorrigible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie looked thoughtful as she seated herself at
the table, and a moment later, under cover of the
general conversation, she leaned over and whispered
to Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Walters said something funny to me,&#8221; she
confided. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure yet whether she was
calling me names or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221; asked Laura, looking interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She said I was incorrigible,&#8221; Billie whispered
back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Incorrigible,&#8221; there was a frown on Laura&#8217;s
forehead, then it suddenly cleared and she smiled
beamingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yes, don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221; she said. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
had it in English class the other day. Incorrigible
means wicked, you know&mdash;bad. You can&#8217;t reform
&#8217;em, you know&mdash;incorrigibles.&#8221; The last word was
mumbled through a mouthful of soup.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t reform &#8217;em!&#8221; Billie repeated in dismay.
&#8220;Goodness, do you suppose that&#8217;s what she really
thinks of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why she shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Laura said wickedly,
and Billie would surely have thrown something
at her if Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s eye had not happened
at that moment to turn in her direction.
</p>
<p>Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s eye brought to Billie&#8217;s mind the
teacher&#8217;s trouble, and she confided it in a low tone
to Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; commented Laura, her mind only on
the fun they were going to have that afternoon,
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, of course, but I don&#8217;t believe any old
album would make me shed tears.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure of that, Laura.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Cry over an old album?&#8221; and Laura
looked her astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose the album had in it the pictures of
those you loved very dearly&mdash;pictures perhaps of
those that were dead and gone and pictures that you
couldn&#8217;t replace?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;I suppose that would be different.
Did she say anything about the people?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t go into details, but she said they
were pictures she prized above anything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, perhaps then that would make a difference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she gets the album back,&#8221; said Billie
seriously.
</p>
<p>Then Laura promptly forgot all about both Miss
Arbuckle and the album.
</p>
<p>A little while later the girls swung joyfully out
upon the road, bound for town and shopping and
perhaps some ice cream and&mdash;oh, just a jolly good
time of the kind girls know so well how to have,
especially in the spring of the year.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>FOUND&mdash;ONE ALBUM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry Connie couldn&#8217;t come along,&#8221; said
Laura, drinking in deep breaths of the fragrant air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Billie, her eyes twinkling. &#8220;She said
she wished she hadn&#8217;t been born with a conscience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A conscience,&#8221; said Vi innocently. &#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Billie, her cheeks aglow with
the heat and exercise, her brown hair clinging in
little damp ringlets to her forehead, and her eyes
bright with health and the love of life, &#8220;then she
could have had a good time to-day instead of staying
at home in a stuffy room and writing a cartload
of letters. She says if she doesn&#8217;t write them, she&#8217;ll
never dare face her friends when she gets home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a darling,&#8221; said Laura, executing a little
skip in the road that sent the dust flying all about
them. &#8220;Just think&mdash;if we hadn&#8217;t met her we
wouldn&#8217;t be looking forward to Lighthouse Island
and a dear old uncle who owns the light&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody would think he was your uncle,&#8221; said
Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he might just as well be,&#8221; Laura retorted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
&#8220;Connie says that he adopts all the boys and girls
about the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that they adopt him,&#8221; Billie added, with a
nod. &#8220;He must be a darling. I&#8217;m just crazy to see
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Connie Danver&#8217;s Uncle Tom attended the lighthouse,
and, living there all the year around, had
become as much of a fixture as the island itself.
Connie loved this uncle of hers, and had told the
girls enough about him to rouse their curiosity and
make them very eager to meet him.
</p>
<p>The girls walked on in silence for a little way
and then, as they came to a path that led into the
woods, Laura stopped suddenly and said in a dramatic
voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you realize where we are, my friends? Do
you, by any chance, remember a tall, thin, wild-eyed
man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Did they remember? In a flash they were back
again in a queer little hut in the woods, where a tall
man stood and stared at them with strange eyes.
</p>
<p>Laura and Vi started to go on, but Billie stood
staring at the path with fascinated eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why,&#8221; she said, as she turned slowly
away in response to the urging of the girls, &#8220;nothing
ever seems the same in the sunlight. The
other night when we were running along that path
we were scared to death, and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sound as if you&#8217;d like to stay scared to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
death,&#8221; said Laura impatiently, for Laura had not
Billie&#8217;s imagination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t like to be scared any more than
any one else,&#8221; Billie retorted. &#8220;But I <i>would</i> like
to see that man again. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she paused
and Vi prompted her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Billie, a thoughtful little crease on
her forehead, &#8220;I was just wondering if we could
find the little hut again if we tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; Laura was very decided
about it. &#8220;We were lost, weren&#8217;t we? And when
the man showed us the way back it was dark&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way I can see,&#8221; said Vi, who often
had rather funny ideas, &#8220;would be to have one of
us stand in the road and hold on to strings tied to
the other two so that if they got lost&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The one in the road could haul &#8217;em back,&#8221; said
Laura sarcastically. &#8220;That&#8217;s a wonderful idea,
Vi.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>would</i> like to see that man again,&#8221; sighed
Billie. &#8220;He seemed so sad. I&#8217;m sure he was in
trouble, and I&#8217;d so like to help him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes and when you offered you nearly got your
head bit off,&#8221; observed Laura.
</p>
<p>Billie&#8217;s eyes twinkled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Daddy says always happens to people
who try to help,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel awfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
sorry for him, just the same,&#8221; she finished decidedly.
</p>
<p>Then Laura did a surprising thing. She put an
arm about Billie&#8217;s shoulders and hugged her fondly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie Bradley,&#8221; she said sadly, &#8220;I do believe
you would feel sorry for a snake that bit you, just
because it was only a snake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that&#8217;s why she loves <i>you</i>,&#8221; said Vi innocently,
and scored a point. Laura looked as if
she wanted to be mad for a minute, but she was
not. She only laughed with the girls.
</p>
<p>They had as good a time as they had expected
to have in town that afternoon&mdash;and that is saying
something.
</p>
<p>First they went shopping. Laura had need of
a ribbon girdle. Although they all knew that a blue
one would be bought in the end, as blue was the
color that would go best with the dress with which
the girdle was to be worn, the merits and beauties of
a green one and a lavender one were discussed and
comparisons made with the blue one over and over,
all from very love of the indecision and, more truly,
the joy that looking at the dainty, pretty colors gave
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think this is the very best of all, Laura,&#8221;
said Billie finally, picking up the pretty blue girdle
with its indistinct pattern of lighter blue and white.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is a beauty,&#8221; replied Laura. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
that one,&#8221; she went on to the clerk.
</p>
<p>After that came numerous smaller purchases until,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
as Vi said dolefully, all their money was gone
except enough to buy several plates of ice cream
apiece.
</p>
<p>They were standing just outside the store where
their last purchases had been made when Billie,
looking down the street, gave a cry of delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look who&#8217;s coming!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the boys!&#8221; cried Vi. &#8220;Mercy, girls, we
might just as well have spent the rest of our money,
the boys will treat us to the ice cream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, Vi! do you want to spend your money
whether you get anything you really need or wish
for or not?&#8221; inquired Billie, with a little gasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world is money for if not to spend?&#8221;
asked Vi, making big and innocent eyes at Billie.
</p>
<p>Just then the boys came within speaking distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is what I call luck!&#8221; exclaimed Ferd
Stowing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Teddy, putting his hand in his
pocket, &#8220;just hear the money jingle. A nice big
check from Dad in just appreciation of his absent
son! What do you girls say to an ice-cream spree?
No less than three apiece, with all this unwonted
wealth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ice cream? I should say!&#8221; was Billie&#8217;s somewhat
slangy acceptance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teddy,&#8221; suddenly asked Laura, &#8220;how does it
come that you have any money left from Dad&#8217;s
check?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Check came just as we left the Academy, Captain
Shelling cashed it for me, and we have just
reached town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Well, maybe I&#8217;ll find one, too, when we
reach Three Towers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it, is it, sister mine? Envy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that they ate ice cream to repletion, and
at last the girls decided that there was nothing much
left to do but to go back to the school.
</p>
<p>It was just as well that they had made this decision,
for the sun was beginning to sink in the west
and the supper hour at Three Towers Hall was
rather early. As they started toward home, having
said good-bye to the boys, the girls quickened their
pace.
</p>
<p>It was not till they were nearing the path which,
to Billie at least, had been surrounded by a mysterious
halo since the adventure of the other night
that the girls slowed up. Then it was Billie who did
the slowing up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she said in a hushed voice, &#8220;I suppose
you&#8217;ll laugh at me, but I&#8217;d just love to follow that
path into the woods a little way. You don&#8217;t need
to come if you don&#8217;t want to. You can wait for me
here in the road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Laura, with a little sigh of resignation.
&#8220;If you are going to be crazy we might
as well be crazy with you. Come on, Vi, if we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
didn&#8217;t go along, she would probably get lost all over
again&mdash;just for the fun of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie made a little face at them and plunged into
the woods. Laura followed, and after a minute&#8217;s
hesitation Vi trailed at Laura&#8217;s heels.
</p>
<p>They were so used to Billie&#8217;s sudden impulses
that they had stopped protesting and merely went
along with her, which, as Billie herself had often
pointed out, saved a great deal of argument.
</p>
<p>They might have saved themselves all worry on
Billie&#8217;s account this time, though, for she had not
the slightest intention of getting lost again&mdash;once
was enough.
</p>
<p>She went only as far as the end of the path, and
when the other girls reached her she was peering
off into the forest as if she hoped to see the mysterious
hut&mdash;although she knew as well as Laura
and Vi that they had walked some distance through
the woods the other night before they had finally
reached the path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, are you satisfied?&#8221; Laura asked, with a
patient sigh. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind my saying it, I&#8217;m
getting hungry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! after all that ice cream?&#8221; cried Billie,
adding with a little chuckle: &#8220;You&#8217;re luckier than
I am, Laura. I feel as if I shouldn&#8217;t want anything
to eat for a thousand years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was just turning reluctantly to follow her
chums back along the path when a dark, bulky-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
object lying in a clump of bushes near by
caught her eye and she went over to examine it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what in the world&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Laura was beginning
despairingly when suddenly Billie gave a
queer little cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here quick, girls!&#8221; she cried, reaching
down to pick up the bulky object which had caught
her attention. &#8220;I do believe&mdash;yes, it is&mdash;it must
be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say it!&#8221; the others cried, peering impatiently
over her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album,&#8221; finished Billie.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>STRANGE ACTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Instead of seeming excited, Laura and Vi
stared. Vi had not even heard that Miss Arbuckle
had lost an album, and Laura just dimly remembered
Billie&#8217;s having said something about it.
</p>
<p>But Billie&#8217;s eyes were shining, and she was all
eagerness as she picked the old-fashioned volume
up and began turning over the pages. She was
thinking of poor Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s red nose and eyes
of that morning and of how different the teacher&#8217;s
face would look when she, Billie, returned the
album.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I felt awfully
sorry for Miss Arbuckle this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wish I knew what you were talking
about,&#8221; said Vi plaintively, and Billie briefly told of
her meeting with Miss Arbuckle in the morning
and of the teacher&#8217;s grief at losing her precious
album.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t see anything very precious
about it,&#8221; sniffed Laura. &#8220;Look&mdash;the corners are
all worn through.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Silly, it doesn&#8217;t make any difference how old it
is,&#8221; said Vi as they started back along the path,
Billie holding on tight to the book. &#8220;It may have
pictures in it she wants to save. It may be&mdash;what
is it they call &#8217;em?&mdash;an heirloom or something. And
Mother says heirlooms are precious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know one that isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Laura, with a
little grimace. &#8220;Mother has a wreath made out of
hair of different members of the family. She says
it&#8217;s precious, too; but I notice she keeps it in the
darkest corner of the attic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this isn&#8217;t a hair wreath, it&#8217;s an album,&#8221;
Billie pointed out. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t blame Miss Arbuckle
for not wanting to lose an album with family
pictures in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did she come to lose it there?&#8221; asked
Laura, as the road could be seen dimly through the
trees. &#8220;The woods seem a funny place. Girls,&#8221;
and Laura&#8217;s eyes began to shine excitedly, &#8220;it&#8217;s a
mystery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; sighed Vi plaintively, &#8220;there she
goes again. Everything has to be a mystery, whether
it is or not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; insisted Laura, turning to
Billie for support. &#8220;A lady says she has lost an
album. In a little while we find that same album&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s the same,&#8221; put in Billie, looking
at the album as if it had not occurred to her before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
that this might not be Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album, after
all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is, silly,&#8221; Laura went on impatiently.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely that two people would be
foolish enough to lose albums on the same day.
If it had been a stick pin now, or a purse&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, go on,&#8221; Billie interrupted. &#8220;You were
talking about mysteries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; demanded Laura, becoming
so excited she could not talk straight. &#8220;What was
Miss Arbuckle doing in the woods with her album,
in the first place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She might have been looking at it,&#8221; suggested
Vi mildly.
</p>
<p>Billie giggled at the look Laura gave Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But may I ask,&#8221; said Laura, trying to
appear very dignified, &#8220;why, if she only wanted to
<i>look</i> at the pictures, she couldn&#8217;t do it some place
else&mdash;in her room, for instance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, I&#8217;m not a detective,&#8221; said poor Vi.
&#8220;If you want to ask any questions go and ask Miss
Arbuckle. I didn&#8217;t lose the old album.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura gave a sigh of exasperation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A person might as well try to talk to a pair of
wooden Indians,&#8221; she cried, then turned appealingly
to Billie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s something mysterious
about it, Billie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it does seem kind of queer,&#8221; Billie admitted,
adding quickly as Laura was about to turn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
upon Vi with a whoop of triumph. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s very mysterious. Probably Miss Arbuckle
just wanted to be alone or something, and
so she brought the album out into the woods to look
it over by herself. I like to do it sometimes myself&mdash;with
a book I mean. Just sneak off where
nobody can find me and read and read until I get
so tired I fall asleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but you can&#8217;t look at pictures in a shabby
old album until you feel so tired you fall asleep,&#8221;
grumbled Laura, feeling like a cat that has just had
a saucer of rich cream snatched from under its
nose. &#8220;You girls wouldn&#8217;t know a mystery if you
fell over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; admitted Billie good-naturedly, her
face brightening as she added, contentedly: &#8220;But
I do know one thing, and that is that Miss Arbuckle
is going to be very glad when she sees this
old album again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she was right. When they reached Three
Towers Hall Laura and Vi went upstairs to the
dormitory to wash up and get ready for supper
while Billie stopped at Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s door, eager
to tell her the good news at once.
</p>
<p>She rapped gently, and, receiving no reply, softly
pushed the door open. Miss Arbuckle was standing
by the window looking out, and somehow Billie
knew, even before the teacher turned around, that
she had been crying again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>The tired droop of the shoulders, the air of discouragement&mdash;suddenly
there flashed across Billie&#8217;s
mind a different picture, the picture of a tall lank
man with stooped shoulders and dark, deep-set eyes,
looking at her strangely.
</p>
<p>A puzzled little line formed itself across her forehead.
Why, she thought, had Miss Arbuckle made
her think of the man who called himself Hugo
Billings and who lived in a hut in the woods?
</p>
<p>Perhaps because they both seemed so very sad.
Yes, that must be it. Then her face brightened as
she felt the bulky album under her arm. Here was
something that would make Miss Arbuckle smile, at
least.
</p>
<p>Billie spoke softly and was taken aback at the
suddenness with which Miss Arbuckle turned upon
her, regarding her with startled eyes.
</p>
<p>For a moment teacher and pupil regarded each
other. Then slowly a pitiful, crooked smile twitched
Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s lips and her hand reached out
gropingly for the back of a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s you,&#8221; she stammered, adding with
an apologetic smile that made her look more natural:
&#8220;I&#8217;m a little nervous to-day&mdash;a little upset.
What is it, Billie? Why didn&#8217;t you knock?&#8221; The
last words were said in Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s calm,
slightly dry voice, and Billie began to feel more
natural herself. She had been frightened when
Miss Arbuckle swung around upon her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Knock, I mean. But
you didn&#8217;t hear me. I found something of yours,
Miss Arbuckle.&#8221; Her eyes fell to the volume she
still carried under her arm, and Miss Arbuckle,
following the direction of her gaze, recognized her
album.
</p>
<p>She gave a little choked cry, and her face grew
so white that Billie ran to her, fearing she hardly
knew what. But she had no need to worry, for
although fear sometimes kills, joy never does, and
in a minute Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s eager hands were
clutching the volume, her fingers trembling as they
rapidly turned over the leaves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, here they are, here they are,&#8221; she cried suddenly,
and Billie, peeping over her shoulder, looked
down at the pictured faces of three of the most
beautiful children she had ever seen. &#8220;My darlings,
my darlings,&#8221; Miss Arbuckle was saying over
and over again. Then suddenly her head dropped
to the open page and her shoulders shook with the
sobs that tore themselves from her.
</p>
<p>Billie turned away and tiptoed across the room,
her own eyes wet, but she stopped with her hand
on the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My little children!&#8221; Miss Arbuckle cried out
sobbingly. &#8220;My precious little babies! I couldn&#8217;t
lose your pictures after losing you. They were all
I had left of you, and I couldn&#8217;t lose them, I
couldn&#8217;t&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Billie opened the door, and, stepping out into
the hall, closed it softly after her. She brushed
her hand across her eyes, for there were tears in
them, and her feet felt shaky as she started up the
stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&mdash;I never!&#8221; she told herself unsteadily.
&#8220;First she nearly scares me to death. And then
she cries and talks about her children, and says
she&#8217;s lost them. Goodness, I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but
that Laura is right after all. There certainly is
something mighty strange about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And when, a few minutes later, she told the story
to her chums they agreed with her, even Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I never heard of such a thing,&#8221; said the
latter, looking interested. &#8220;You say she seemed
frightened when you went in, Billie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Terribly,&#8221; answered Billie. &#8220;It seemed as if
she might faint or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the children,&#8221; Laura mused delightedly
aloud. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out who those children
are and why they are lost if I die doing it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look who she thinks she is,&#8221; jeered Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Laura with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Lady Detective,&#8221; said Vi, and
Laura&#8217;s chest, if one takes Billie&#8217;s word for it,
swelled to about three times its natural size.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Laura, in response to the
girls&#8217; gibes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get in some clever work, with
nothing but a silly old photograph album as a clue,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
or a motive&mdash;oh, well, I don&#8217;t know just what the
album is yet, but an album is worse than commonplace,
it is plumb foolish as a center around which
to work. Oh, ho! Great Lady Detective! Solves
most marvelous and intricate mystery with only the
slightest of clues, an old photograph album, to point
the way! Oh, ho!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN INVITATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The girls could never have told exactly why, but
they kept the mystery of the album and Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s
strange actions to themselves, with one exception.
</p>
<p>They did confide their secret to fluffy-haired,
blue-eyed Connie Danvers. For they had long ago
adopted Connie as one of themselves and were
beginning to feel that they had known her all their
lives.
</p>
<p>Connie had been interested enough in their story
to satisfy even the chums and had urged Billie to
describe the pretty children in the album over whom
Miss Arbuckle had cried.
</p>
<p>Billie tried, but, having seen the pictures but once,
it was hardly to be expected that she would be able
to give the girls a very clear description of them.
</p>
<p>It was good enough to satisfy Connie, however,
who, in her enthusiasm, went so far as to suggest
that they form a Detective Club.
</p>
<p>This the girls might have done if it had not been
for an interruption in the form of Chet Bradley,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Teddy Jordon and their chum, Ferd Stowing.
</p>
<p>The boys had entered Boxton Military Academy
at the time the girls had entered Three Towers
Hall, and the boys were as enthusiastic about their
academy as the girls were about their beloved
school.
</p>
<p>The head of Boxton Military Academy was Captain
Shelling, a splendid example of army officer
whom all the students loved and admired. They
did not know it, but there was not one of the boys
in the school who did not hope that some day he
might be like Captain Shelling.
</p>
<p>Now, as the spring term was drawing to a close,
there were great preparations being made at the
Academy for the annual parade of cadets.
</p>
<p>The girls knew that visitors were allowed, and
they were beginning to wonder a little uneasily
whether they were to be invited or not when one
afternoon the boys turned up and settled the question
for them very satisfactorily.
</p>
<p>It was Saturday afternoon, just a week after the
finding of Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album, and the girls,
Laura, Billie, Vi and Connie, were wandering arm
in arm about the beautiful campus of Three
Towers Hall when a familiar hail came to them
from the direction of the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Chet,&#8221; said Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t&mdash;it&#8217;s Teddy,&#8221; contradicted Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s both of &#8217;em,&#8221; added Vi.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are both wrong,&#8221; said Connie, gazing
eagerly through the trees. &#8220;Here they come, girls.
Look, there are four of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are four of them,&#8221; mocked Laura,
mischievous eyes on Connie&#8217;s reddening face. &#8220;The
third is Ferd Stowing, of course. And I wonder,
oh, I wonder, who the fourth can be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so silly! I think you&#8217;re horrid!&#8221; cried
Connie, which only made Laura chuckle the more.
</p>
<p>For while they had been at the Academy, the
boys had made a friend. His name was Paul Martinson,
and he was tall and strongly built and&mdash;yes,
even Billie had to admit it&mdash;almost as good
looking as Teddy!
</p>
<p>If Billie said that about any one it was pretty
sure to be true. For Billie and Teddy Jordon had
been chums and playmates since they could remember,
and Billie had always been sure that Teddy
must be the very best looking boy in the world, not
even excepting her brother Chet, of whom she was
very fond.
</p>
<p>But Billie was not the only one who had found
Paul Martinson good looking. Connie had liked
him, and had said innocently one day after the boys
had gone that Paul Martinson looked like the hero
in a story book she was reading.
</p>
<p>The girls had giggled, and since then Laura had
made poor Connie&#8217;s life miserable&mdash;or so Connie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
declared. She could not have forgotten Paul Martinson,
even if she had wanted to.
</p>
<p>As for Paul Martinson, he had shown a liking
for Billie that somehow made Teddy uncomfortable.
Teddy was very much surprised to find how
uncomfortable it did make him. Billie was a &#8220;good
little chum and all that, but that didn&#8217;t say that another
fellow couldn&#8217;t speak to her.&#8221; But just the
same he had acted so queerly two or three times
lately that Billie had bothered him exceedingly asking
him what the matter with him was and telling
him to &#8220;cheer up, it wasn&#8217;t somebody&#8217;s funeral, you
know.&#8221; Billie had been puzzled over his answer to
that. He had muttered something about &#8220;it&#8217;s not
anybody&#8217;s funeral yet, maybe, but everything had
to start sometime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Billie had innocently told Laura about it
she was still more puzzled at the way Laura had
acted. Instead of being sensible, she had suddenly
buried her face in the pillow&mdash;they had been sitting
on Billie&#8217;s bed, exchanging confidences&mdash;and fairly
shook with laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what in the world&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Billie had begun
rather resentfully, when Laura had interrupted her
with an hysterical: &#8220;For goodness sake, Billie, I
never thought you could be so dense. But you are.
You&#8217;re absolutely crazy, and so is Teddy, and so is
everybody!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>And after that Billie never confided any of
Teddy&#8217;s sayings to Laura again.
</p>
<p>On this particular afternoon it did not take the
girls long to find out that the boys had some good
news to tell them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on down to the dock,&#8221; Teddy said, taking
hold of Billie&#8217;s arm and urging her down toward
the lake as he spoke. &#8220;Maybe we can find some
canoes and rowboats that aren&#8217;t working.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when they reached the dock there was never
a craft of any kind to be seen except those far
out upon the glistening water of the lake. Of
course the beautiful weather was responsible for
this, for all the girls who had not lessons to do or
errands in town had made a bee line&mdash;as Ferd
Stowing expressed it&mdash;straight down to the lake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, this will do,&#8221; said Teddy, sitting down
on the edge of the little dock so that his feet could
hang over and reaching up a hand for Billie. &#8220;Come
along, everybody. We can look at the water, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls and boys scrambled down obediently
and there was great excitement when Connie&#8217;s foot
slipped and she very nearly tumbled into the lake.
Paul Martinson steadied her, and she thanked him
with a little blush that made Laura look at her
wickedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How beautifully pink your complexion is in the
warm weather, Connie,&#8221; she said innocently, adding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
with a little look that made Connie want to
shake her: &#8220;It can&#8217;t be anything <i>but</i> the heat, can
it? You haven&#8217;t a fever, or something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But you&#8217;ll have something beside a fever,&#8221;
threatened Connie, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t keep still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, stop your rowing, girls, and listen to me,&#8221;
Teddy interrupted, picking a pebble from the dock
and throwing it far out into the gleaming water,
where it dropped with a little splash. &#8220;Our famous
parade of cadets comes off next week. You&#8217;re going
to be on deck, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might,&#8221; said Billie, with a demure little
glance at him, &#8220;if somebody would only ask us!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AMANDA AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>The great day came at last and found the girls
in a fever of mingled excitement and fear. Excitement
because of the great advent; fear, because
the sky had been overcast since early morning and
it looked as if the whole thing might have to be
postponed on account of rain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if there is anything I hate,&#8221; complained
Laura, moving restlessly from her mirror over to
the window and back again, &#8220;it&#8217;s to be all prepared
for a thing and then have it spoiled at the last minute
by rain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you don&#8217;t hate it any more than
the rest of us,&#8221; said Billie, her thoughts on the
pretty pink flowered dress she had decided to wear
to the parade. It was not only a pretty dress, but
was very becoming. Both Teddy and Chet had told
her so. &#8220;And the boys would be terribly disappointed,&#8221;
she added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; Vi was sitting on the bed, sewing a
hook and eye on the dress she had intended to wear,
&#8220;if Amanda Peabody and The Shadow will be
there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>Laura turned abruptly from the window and regarded
her with a reproachful stare.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know you&#8217;re a joy killer,&#8221; she said; &#8220;for
if Amanda Peabody and The Shadow (the name
the girls had given Eliza Dilks because she always
followed Amanda as closely as a shadow does)
succeeded in getting themselves invited to any sort
of affair where we girls were to be, they would be
sure to do something annoying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to be there, just the same,&#8221; said
Billie, and the two girls looked at her in surprise.
&#8220;They told me so,&#8221; she said, in answer to the unspoken
question. &#8220;They have some sort of relatives
among the boys at the Academy, and these
relatives didn&#8217;t have sense enough not to invite
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted Laura, &#8220;Amanda probably
hinted around till the boys couldn&#8217;t help inviting
her. Look&mdash;oh, look!&#8221; she cried in such a different
tone that the girls stared at her. &#8220;The sun!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s going to clear up, it&#8217;s going to
clear up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t step on my blue silk for all
that,&#8221; complained Vi, as Laura caught an exultant
heel in the latter&#8217;s dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be grouchy, darling,&#8221; said Laura, all
good-nature again now that the sun had appeared.
&#8220;My, but we&#8217;re going to have a good time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say we are,&#8221; sang out Billie, as she gayly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
spread out the pink flowered dress upon the bed.
&#8220;And we&#8217;re not going to let anybody spoil it either&mdash;even
Eliza Dilks and Amanda Peabody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls had an hour in which to get ready, and
they were ready and waiting before half that time
was up. The Three Towers Hall carryall was to
call for the girls who had been lucky enough to receive
invitations from the cadets of Boxton Military
Academy, and as the girls, looking like gay-colored
butterflies in their summery dresses, gathered
on the steps of the school there were so many
of them that it began to look as if the carryall would
have to make two trips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we have to go in sections I wonder whether
we&#8217;ll be in the first or second,&#8221; Vi was saying when
Billie grasped her arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; she cried, merriment in her eyes and in
her voice. &#8220;Here come Amanda and Eliza. Did
you ever see anything so funny&mdash;and awful&mdash;in
your life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For Amanda and her chum were dressed in their
Sunday best&mdash;poplin dresses with a huge, gorgeous
flower design that made the pretty, delicate-colored
dresses of the other girls look pale and washed-out
by comparison. If Amanda&#8217;s and Eliza&#8217;s desire
was to be the most noticeable and talked-of
girls on the parade, they were certainly going to
succeed. The talk had begun already!
</p>
<p>However, the arrival of the carryall cut short the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
girls&#8217; amusement, and there was great excitement
and noise and giggling as the girls&mdash;all who could
get in, that is&mdash;clambered in.
</p>
<p>There were about a dozen left over, and these
the driver promised to come back and pick up &#8220;in
a jiffy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling awfully nervous,&#8221; Laura confided
to Billie. &#8220;I never expected to be nervous; did
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; Billie answered truthfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been nervous ever since the boys invited us. It&#8217;s
because it&#8217;s all so new, I guess. We&#8217;ve never been
to anything like this before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frightened to death when I think of meeting
Captain Shelling,&#8221; Connie leaned across Vi to
say. &#8220;From what the boys say about him he must
be simply wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul had better look out,&#8221; said Laura slyly, and
Connie drew back sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re mean to tease Connie so,&#8221; spoke
up Vi. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t like Paul Martinson any better
than the rest of us do, and you know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do, do I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Laura, but Billie
broke in hastily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;stop your quarreling. Look!
We&#8217;re at the Academy. And&mdash;look&mdash;look&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Words failed her, and she just stared wonderingly
at the sight that met her eyes. It was true, none
of them had ever seen anything like it before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>Booths of all sorts and colors were distributed
over the parade ground, leaving free only the part
where the cadets were to march. Girls in bright-colored
dresses and boys in trim uniforms were already
walking about making brilliant patches of
color against the green of the parade ground.
</p>
<p>There were some older people, too, fathers and
mothers of the boys, but the groups were mostly
made up of young people, gay and excited with
the exhilaration of the moment.
</p>
<p>There were girls and matrons in the costume of
French peasants wandering in and out among the
visitors, carrying little baskets filled with ribbon-tied
packages. Some of these packages contained
candy, some just little foolish things to make the
young folks laugh, favors to take away with them
and remember the day by.
</p>
<p>As the carryall stopped and one after another the
girls jumped to the ground they were surprised to
find that their nervousness, instead of growing less,
was getting worse and worse all the time.
</p>
<p>They were standing on the edge of things, wondering
just what to do next and wishing some one
would meet them when some one did just that
very thing.
</p>
<p>Paul Martinson spied the carryall from Three
Towers Hall, called to a couple of his friends, and
came running down toward the girls, his handsome
face alight with pleasure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said. &#8220;We thought you were never
coming. Say, you make all the other girls look like
nothing at all.&#8221; He was supposed to be talking to
them all, but he was looking straight at Billie.
</p>
<p>But although the other girls noticed it, Billie did
not. She was looking beyond Paul to where three
boys, Teddy in the lead, were bearing down upon
them.
</p>
<p>After that the boys soon made their guests feel
as if they had never been nervous in their lives,
and they entered into the fun with all their hearts.
</p>
<p>The parade of cadets was the most wonderful
part of it all, of course, and the girls stood through
it, their hearts beating wildly, a delicious wave of
patriotism thrilling to their finger tips. And when
it was over the girls looked at Teddy and Chet and
Ferd and Paul with a new respect that the boys
liked but did not understand at all.
</p>
<p>Several times during the afternoon they came
across Eliza and Amanda and their escorts&mdash;who
did not look like bad boys at all. But only once
did the girls try to shove to the front.
</p>
<p>It was when Teddy and Paul had taken Billie and
Connie over to the ice cream booth for refreshments,
the other boys and girls having wandered off
somewhere by themselves.
</p>
<p>Billie was standing up near the counter when
Eliza Dilks deliberately elbowed her way in ahead
of her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>Billie began to feel herself getting angry, but
before she could say anything, Teddy spoke over
her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please serve us next,&#8221; he said to the pleasant-faced
matron who had charge of this part of the
refreshments. &#8220;Some of these others just came
in and belong at the end of the line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I noticed you were here first,&#8221; the woman
answered, and handed Billie her ice cream over
Eliza&#8217;s head while Eliza, with a glance at Billie
that should have killed her on the spot, turned
sullenly and walked away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teddy, you&#8217;re a wonder,&#8221; murmured Billie under
her breath. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done it like that
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After this encounter Billie and her party wandered
over to the dancing pavilion on the outside
of which they met Laura and Vi and their escorts
for the afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the dandiest band in the world?&#8221;
sighed Billie in supreme content. &#8220;Such music
would make&mdash;would make even Amanda Peabody
dance well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come, Billie, that&#8217;s too much!&#8221; laughed
Teddy, swinging her on to the floor and giving
her what she called a heavenly dance.
</p>
<p>And indeed what could have been better fun than
this dance on a smooth floor so large that it did not
seem crowded, to the best of music, with a partner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
who was a perfect dancer, and&mdash;though Billie did
not say this to herself&mdash;by a girl who was herself
as light and graceful a dancer as was on the floor?
</p>
<p>All things must end, even the most perfect day
in a lifetime, as Vi called it, and finally the girls
had been tucked into the carryall and were once
more back at Three Towers Hall, ready, with a
new day, to take up the routine of school life once
more.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>TWO OF A KIND</h3>
</div>

<p>Several days had passed, and the girls were at
last actually looking forward to the end of the
school term and to the Danvers bungalow on Lighthouse
Island!
</p>
<p>The graduates were running around excitedly in
the last preparations for graduation with the
strange look on their young faces that most graduates
have, half exultation at the thought of their
success, half grief at being forced to leave the
school, the friends they had made, the scenes they
had loved.
</p>
<p>Just the day before the one set for graduation
Teddy ran over to tell the girls some wonderful
news. He was able to see only Billie, for the other
girls had been busy with their lessons. But that
was very satisfactory to Teddy.
</p>
<p>As soon as the lunch gong rang Billie had called
the girls together and eagerly she told them what
Teddy had told her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul Martinson&#8217;s father gave him a beautiful
big motor boat&mdash;a cruising motor boat,&#8221; she told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the girls. &#8220;Paul got the highest average in his class
this term, you know, and his father has given him
the motor boat as a sort of prize.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A motor boat!&#8221; cried Vi, breathlessly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
some prize.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Billie, what&#8217;s that got to do with us?&#8221; asked
Laura practically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t much to do with us,&#8221; said Billie, her
face pink with excitement. &#8220;But it has a great deal
to do with the boys. Paul Martinson has asked
Chet and Ferd and Teddy to go with him and his
father on a cruise this summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused from lack of breath, and the girls
looked at her in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, that&#8217;s wonderful for them,&#8221; said Laura
after a minute, adding a little regretfully: &#8220;But I
suppose it means that we won&#8217;t see very much of
the boys this summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but that&#8217;s just what it doesn&#8217;t mean!&#8221; Billie
interrupted eagerly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? Why, Teddy
said that it would be the easiest thing in the world
to stop off at Lighthouse Island some time and see
us girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls agreed that it was all perfectly wonderful,
that everything was working just for them,
and that this couldn&#8217;t possibly help being the most
wonderful summer they had ever spent.
</p>
<p>They did not have as much time to think about
it as they would have liked, however, in the busy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
excited hours that followed. Right after the graduating
exercises all the girls were to start for their
homes, except the few who expected to spend the
summer at Three Towers Hall.
</p>
<p>Many of the relatives and friends of the graduates
were expected, so that preparations had to be
made for them also. The graduating exercises were
to be held earlier at Boxton Military Academy than
at Three Towers Hall, so that the three North Bend
boys hoped to get away in time to attend&mdash;not the
exercises themselves&mdash;but the singing on the steps
of Three Towers Hall by all the students of the
school, which was one of the most important parts
of the ceremony.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, the boys would be able to go
with the girls all the way to North Bend.
</p>
<p>The exercises that had been looked forward to
for so long and that had taken weeks of preparation
to perfect, were over at last. The graduates realized
with a sinking of the heart that they were no
longer students of Three Towers Hall.
</p>
<p>There was still the mass singing on the steps, to
be sure, but that was simply the last barrier to be
crossed before they stepped out on the open road,
leaving Three Towers Hall with its pleasing associations
behind them forever.
</p>
<p>As the girls, in their simple white dresses, gathered
on the steps of the school with the visitors,
fathers and mothers and boys in uniform, scattered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
about on the campus below them, and began to sing
in their clear, girlish voices, there was hardly a dry
eye anywhere.
</p>
<p>At last it was over, and the girls rushed upstairs
again to change their dresses for traveling clothes
and say a last good-bye to their teachers and to
Miss Walters.
</p>
<p>As Billie was hurrying down the corridor, bag in
hand, toward the front door a hand was laid gently
on her arm, and, turning, she found herself face
to face with Miss Arbuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie,&#8221; said the teacher hurriedly, &#8220;I have never
thanked you rightly for the great favor you did in
returning my album to me. But I love you for it,
dear. God bless you,&#8221; and before Billie could
think of a word to say in reply, the teacher had
turned, slipped through one of the doors and disappeared.
</p>
<p>Billie stood staring after Miss Arbuckle, lost in
thought about her, until Laura and Vi, hurrying
up, caught her by the arm and hustled her through
the front door, down the steps and into the waiting
carryall. The carryall, by the way, was to make
many trips that day, even though a great many of
the girls had automobiles belonging to their relatives
or friends which would take them straight to
their destination.
</p>
<p>When the girls had climbed inside, the boys
jumped in after them, and the carryall, having by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
this time all that it could hold, started down the
long, winding driveway to the road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Three Towers, for a little time, at
least,&#8221; cried Billie, while she felt a curious lump in
her throat. She was terribly afraid she was going
to cry, so she stopped talking and turned to stare
out of the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a wonderful time there,&#8221; said Laura
in, for her, a very sober tone. &#8220;Better than we
expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is going <i>some</i>,&#8221; finished Vi slangily,
and as slang from Vi somehow always made them
laugh, they laughed now and felt better for it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we didn&#8217;t have such a very slow time ourselves,&#8221;
said Billie&#8217;s brother Chet, his good looking
face lighting up with eagerness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s something to have made a friend like
Paul Martinson,&#8221; spoke up Ferd Stowing from
where he was squeezed in between Laura and Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet&mdash;he&#8217;s some boy,&#8221; added Teddy heartily,
forgetting for the moment that there had been times
when he had longed to throw Paul Martinson into
the lake&mdash;or some deeper place&mdash;because he had
talked too much to Billie.
</p>
<p>But here was a beautiful long train ride before
him when he could talk to Billie&mdash;or any one else&mdash;all
he liked without having any Paul Martinson trying
to &#8220;butt in&#8221; all the time. No wonder he was
friends with all the world.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Paul? Why didn&#8217;t he come with us?&#8221;
asked Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went home with his dad,&#8221; Chet explained.
&#8220;Of course he was crazy to see his motor boat, and
then he had to make arrangements for our cruise.
Oh boy, think of cruising around the coast in a
motor boat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted Connie to come along with us,&#8221; said
Billie. &#8220;But she said she would have to go home
first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When are you girls going to start for Lighthouse
Island?&#8221; Ferd asked with interest. &#8220;Have
you set any time yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a regular date,&#8221; answered Laura. &#8220;But it
will be in a week or two I think. We&#8217;ll have to
have time to get acquainted with the folks again and
have our clothes fixed up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then Connie&#8217;s coming on to North Bend,&#8221;
Vi added eagerly. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll all go together from
there to the coast. Oh dear, I can&#8217;t wait to start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; said Billie, with a
sigh, &#8220;since we haven&#8217;t even reached home yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; said Laura, turning upon
Billie accusingly. &#8220;What were you doing standing
in the hall just now and looking as though you had
lost your last friend when Vi and I came along and
woke you up? Come on, 'fess up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie could not think for a moment what she
had been doing, then she remembered Miss Arbuckle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and the rather peculiar way the teacher had thanked
her for the return of the album.
</p>
<p>She told the girls about it, and they listened with
interest while the boys looked as if they would like
to have known what it was all about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Laura was beginning when
Billie suddenly caught her hand and pointed to the
road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s Hugo Billings, our sad,
faced man again. Oh, girls, I wish we could do
something for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She leaned far out the window, smiled and waved
her hand to the man, who was standing moodily by
the roadside. At sight of her he straightened up
and an answering smile flashed across his thin face,
making him look so different that the girls were
amazed.
</p>
<p>But when they looked back at him again a few
seconds later his smile had gone and he was staring
after them gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, I never saw a person look so sad in
all my life,&#8221; murmured Vi, as a turn in the road hid
the man from view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have,&#8221; said Billie. &#8220;And that&#8217;s Miss
Arbuckle!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be some sort of mystery about them
both,&#8221; remarked Laura. &#8220;Maybe that man has a
whole lot on his mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And maybe Miss Arbuckle isn&#8217;t miss at all,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
added Vi. &#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s Mrs. Arbuckle and those
children were her own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie did not reply to this. She heaved something
of a sigh. She was unable to explain it, but
she felt very sorry for both the teacher and the
queer man. Would the queer mystery ever be explained?

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AT HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>A few hours later a train puffed noisily into the
familiar station at North Bend, and as it came to a
stop three boys and three girls tumbled down the
steps of a car and literally ran into the arms of
their waiting families.
</p>
<p>At least, the girls did; the boys considered themselves
far too dignified. However, they soon forgot
dignity and everything else in a noisy and joyful
recital of all the good times they had had during
their year of absence.
</p>
<p>Of course there had been others from the Military
Academy and Three Towers Hall on the train
whose friends and relatives had also come to meet
them so that it was a very much excited crowd that
wound its way up the ordinarily quiet main street
of North Bend.
</p>
<p>Gradually the crowd separated into little groups,
each going its separate way to its separate home,
and so at last, after many promises between the
boys and girls to &#8220;call each other up right after
dinner,&#8221; the Bradley family found itself alone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Bradley, beaming proudly upon
his children, who seemed to him to have grown at
least twice as large during their absence, and three
times as handsome, &#8220;you thought you <i>would</i> come
back to your poor old country relations, did you?
Your mother and I,&#8221; he glanced fondly at his wife,
&#8220;thought perhaps you had forgotten us by this
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t very much worried, though,&#8221; said
Mrs. Bradley, looking so lovely in her happiness
that Billie had to snuggle close to her to make sure
she was real. For Mrs. Bradley was really a very
beautiful woman, as well as a very sweet one, and
Billie was growing more like her every day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s the darling old house,&#8221; breathed
Billie happily, &#8220;looking just the same as it did when
I left it. Mother dear, and, Dad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; here she
reached a hand out to her father&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;I think I&#8217;m
the very happiest girl in all the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a day or two after that it seemed the best
thing in the world just to be at home again. But
the third day the girls began to feel a little bit restless.
They were longing to be off to Lighthouse
Island with Connie Danvers. But they had not
heard from Connie yet, and until they did there was
nothing to be done but get things in shape and wait.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose she should change her mind,&#8221; remarked
Laura dolefully on the noon of the third day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Change her mind!&#8221; burst out Vi. She turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
enquiringly to Billie. &#8220;Do you think Connie would
do anything like that?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; was Billie&#8217;s quick reply. &#8220;Connie
isn&#8217;t that kind of a girl. Besides all the arrangements
have been made. It is more than likely she
has been so busy with a number of details that she
has simply forgotten to write or telegraph.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, this waiting is getting on my
nerves,&#8221; declared Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do something to make the time pass more
quickly,&#8221; suggested Billie. &#8220;What do you say to
going down town for a bit of shopping?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That suits me,&#8221; answered Vi. &#8220;And we might
have some ice-cream sodas while we are down
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This suited all of them, and soon they were on
the way to the shops where they spent the best part
of the afternoon.
</p>
<p>Then one day, over a week later, when they had
begun to think that Connie had forgotten about
them, a telegram came from her, saying that she
was starting for North Bend the day after the next
and she would be in on the six o&#8217;clock train. Would
somebody please be there to meet her? Her mother
and father had gone on ahead to Lighthouse Island
to get everything ready for the girls when they
arrived.
</p>
<p>Would they be there to meet her! Billie was so
excited that she couldn&#8217;t eat her supper, and as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
soon as she could get away from the table she
rushed over to Laura&#8217;s home to tell her the joyful
news. From there the pair called up Vi and invited
her to come and celebrate.
</p>
<p>And celebrate they did until it got so late that
Mrs. Jordon had gently but firmly to put them out,
appointing Teddy to escort the girls home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your mothers to think I&#8217;ve kidnapped
you,&#8221; she called after them as she and
Laura, the latter pouting a little, stood in the doorway
to wave good-bye to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, I think you might have let them
stay a little longer,&#8221; protested Laura as they turned
to go inside. &#8220;It&#8217;s only ten o&#8217;clock, and we had so
much to talk about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Mrs. Jordon, putting an arm
lightly about her young daughter&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;I
was the same way at your age, dear. Mother had
to send away my friends and put me to bed regularly
every week or so. Now it&#8217;s my turn, that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Teddy and Billie had dropped Vi at
her house and had turned down the broad, elm-shaded
street on which stood the Bradley home.
</p>
<p>For some reason or other they did not talk very
much. They did not seem to find anything to say.
Billie had never been alone like this with Teddy
before, and she was wondering why it made her
tongue-tied.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Billie,&#8221; began Teddy, clearing his throat
and looking down at her sideways&mdash;for all the
world, as Billie thought, as if she were a mouse
trap and might go off any minute&mdash;&#8220;is it really settled
that you are going to start day after to-morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221; cried Billie, finding
her voice as the blissful prospect opened up before
her again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never stayed at the seashore
more than a day or two, Teddy, in my life, and now
just think of spending the whole summer there. I
can&#8217;t believe yet that it isn&#8217;t a dream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to be careful,&#8221; said Teddy, staring
straight before him, &#8220;if you go in bathing at all.
There are awfully strong currents around there, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course I know all about that,&#8221; returned
Billie, with the air of one who could not possibly
be taught anything. &#8220;Connie says her Uncle Tom
knows of a darling little inlet where the water&#8217;s so
calm it&#8217;s almost like a swimming pool. Of course
we&#8217;ll do most of our swimming there. Oh, Teddy,
you ought to see my new bathing suit!&#8221; She was
rattling on rapturously when Teddy interrupted
with a queer sort of question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this Uncle Tom?&#8221; he asked, still staring
straight ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s Connie&#8217;s uncle, of course! The
keeper of the light on Lighthouse Island,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Billie, as surprised as if he had asked her
who Abraham Lincoln was. &#8220;Connie says he&#8217;s a
darling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he married?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why no. That is, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered
Billie, knitting her brows in an effort to think
whether Connie had ever said anything on this
point. She had never even thought to ask if &#8220;Uncle
Tom&#8221; was married. &#8220;Why, no, of course he can&#8217;t
be,&#8221; she answered herself and Teddy at the same
time. &#8220;If he was married he wouldn&#8217;t be living in
that old lighthouse all alone. And Connie said he
did live there all alone. I remember that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She nodded her head with satisfaction, but,
strangely enough, Teddy did not seem to be satisfied
at all. He just stalked along beside her in a
sort of gloomy silence while she glanced up at him
now and then with a mischievous hint of a laugh
dancing about her pretty mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teddy, where are you going?&#8221; she asked a minute
later, as they reached the sidewalk that led to
her house and instead of stopping Teddy stalked
straight on. &#8220;I don&#8217;t live down at the corner you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Teddy turned about with a sort of sheepish
grin and rejoined her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; he said as they turned up
the walk together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder you went past,&#8221; said Billie mischievously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
Then as they paused at the foot of the
steps she looked up at him with an imp of laughter
showing all the dimples about her mouth. &#8220;What
were you thinking so hard about, Teddy?&#8221; she
dared him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; said Teddy, clearing his throat
and looking anywhere but at Billie, &#8220;that I wouldn&#8217;t
mind going down to Lighthouse Island myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he fled, leaving Billie to get into the house
as best she could. But Billie did not mind. She
was chuckling to herself and thinking how funny
and foolish and&mdash;yes&mdash;awfully nice Teddy could
be&mdash;sometimes.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>PREPARING FOR THE TRIP</h3>
</div>

<p>Chet and Billie were at the train to meet Connie
when she arrived, for it had been decided almost
without argument that Connie would spend her one
night in North Bend with the Bradleys.
</p>
<p>Billie was in a fever of excitement even before
the stream of people began to pour from the train,
and when she saw Connie she made a wild dash for
her that very nearly bowled over a couple of unfortunate
men who were in the path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling!&#8221; cried Billie, hugging her friend
rapturously. &#8220;Now I know it&#8217;s all true. I was
just scared to death for fear something would happen
and you couldn&#8217;t get here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poor Chet tried his best to edge his way in and
speak a word to Connie on his own account&mdash;for
Chet liked Connie Danvers very much&mdash;but he
could not do any more than shake hands with her
over Billie&#8217;s shoulder and mumble one or two words
which neither of the girls understood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t speak to you,&#8221; he grumbled to himself
as he brought up the rear with Connie&#8217;s suitcase
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
and a hat box, &#8220;and the only time they know
you&#8217;re alive is when they want a baggage truck or
something. Catch me ever coming to meet one of
Billie&#8217;s friends again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was relieved when Vi and Laura came running
up all flushed with their hurry to &#8220;spill over
Connie&#8221; some more, as Chet disgustedly put it and
he had a chance to slip down a side street and &#8220;beat
it&#8221; for home.
</p>
<p>None of the girls even noticed that Chet had
gone; a fact which, had he known it, would have
made the boy still more disgusted with girls and
everything about them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie, you do look sweet,&#8221; Vi cried, as they
all four tried to walk abreast along a sidewalk that
was not very wide&mdash;the result being that Laura,
who was on the end, walked half the time on the
curb and the rest of the time in the gutter. &#8220;Is that
a new hat? And, oh, I know you&#8217;ve got a new
dress!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m not the only one who looks nice,&#8221; said
Connie, who, in spite of her prettiness, was very
modest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are a mess,&#8221; said Laura, balancing nicely
between the curb and the gutter. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got on
our oldest dresses because everything we own is
packed except the things we&#8217;re going to wear to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; That was the magic word that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
unlocked the gates and let through a flood of conversation
consisting of excited questions and answers
and joyful exclamations that lasted until they
reached Billie&#8217;s house.
</p>
<p>Billie asked Laura and Vi in, but they reluctantly
refused, saying that their mothers had expressly
ordered them to be home that day in time
for dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t come over to-night,&#8221; Vi called back
to them, as she and Laura started on arm in arm.
&#8220;Mother says I have to get to bed early.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll see you the first thing in the morning,&#8221;
added Laura. &#8220;The very first thing, remember
that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say so,&#8221; Billie sang back gayly, and then led
her guest up the porch steps and into the house,
where her mother was waiting to receive them. Mrs.
Bradley and Connie fell in love with each other at
first sight&mdash;which was the last thing needed to make
Billie absolutely happy.
</p>
<p>They went to bed early that night, the two girls
snuggled in Billie&#8217;s pretty bird&#8217;s-eye maple bed in
Billie&#8217;s pretty bird&#8217;s-eye maple room.
</p>
<p>They went to bed, but neither of the girls had
either the desire or the intention of going to sleep.
They felt as if they never wanted to go to sleep
again.
</p>
<p>And so they talked. They talked of the next day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and the vacation before them until they could not
think of another thing to say about it.
</p>
<p>Then they talked of the things that had happened
at Three Towers Hall&mdash;of the &#8220;Dill Pickles&#8221; and
of Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks. And last,
but not least, they talked in hushed tones of the mysterious
little hut in the woods and the strange man
who lived there and wove fern baskets and other
things for a living.
</p>
<p>By the time they had reached Miss Arbuckle and
the finding of her album in the woods they were
feeling delightfully thrilly and farther away from
sleep than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It really must be a mystery,&#8221; Connie was saying,
snuggling deeper into the covers and staring at
Billie&#8217;s pretty face and tousled hair weirdly illumined
by the pale moonlight that sifted through the window,
when there came a tap on the door. And right
upon the tap came Mrs. Bradley, wearing a loose
robe that made her look mysteriously lovely in the
dim light. She sat down on the edge of the bed
and regarded the girls smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said, and they stared
at her unbelievingly. &#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she repeated
relentlessly, &#8220;and time for girls who have
to be up early in the morning to be asleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not sleepy,&#8221; protested Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; added Connie.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Bradley rose decidedly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s time you were,&#8221; she said, adding, with
a little laugh: &#8220;If I hear a sound in here ten minutes
from now, I&#8217;m coming after you with a broomstick.
Remember,&#8221; she added, laughing back at
them from the doorway, &#8220;I give you just ten minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve got just the loveliest mother,&#8221;
sighed Connie, as she turned over obediently with
her back to Billie; &#8220;but I&#8217;m sure I never can go to
sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Five minutes passed, and the girls who could
&#8220;never go to sleep,&#8221; felt their eyelids grow heavy
and a delicious drowsiness steal over them. Once
Connie roused herself enough to say sleepily: &#8220;We&#8217;ll
just have to form that Detective Club, Billie, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Billie, already half in the land of
dreams. &#8220;When we&mdash;have&mdash;the time&mdash;good night,
Connie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Bil-lie&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the next they knew it was morning! And
such a glorious morning had never dawned before&mdash;of
that they were sure.
</p>
<p>Fat Deborah, nicknamed &#8220;Debbie,&#8221; who had been
the cook in the Bradley family for years, and who
thought that gave her the right to tell the whole
family what was expected of them, from Billie up
to Mr. Bradley himself, cooked them a breakfast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
of ham and eggs and cereal and toast and corn
bread, grumbling to herself all the time.
</p>
<p>For Debbie did not approve at all of &#8220;the young
folks scamperin&#8217; off jes&#8217; so soon as dey gets back
home agin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Scand'lous, I calls it,&#8221; Debbie confided to the
pan of corn bread she was busily cutting into golden
brown pieces. &#8220;Don' know what Miz Bradley 'lows
she&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; on, nohow. But these am scand'lous
days&mdash;they sho is.&#8221; Whereupon she put on a white
apron and her dignity and marched into the dining
room.
</p>
<p>Yet in spite of her disapproval, Debbie gave the
young &#8220;scalawags&#8221; the best breakfast she could
make, and from the way the young &#8220;scalawags&#8221;
did justice to it, one might have thought they did
not expect to get any more to eat for a week at
least.
</p>
<p>Then they went upstairs to pack bags with the
last minute things. Billie and Connie went over
the whole list backward to be sure they had not
forgotten a toothbrush &#8220;or something.&#8221; To them it
was a very important list.
</p>
<p>And when everything was done and their hats
and coats on, they found to their dismay that they
still had three-quarters of an hour to wait for the
train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, why did Mother call us so early!&#8221;
wailed Billie, sitting down on her suitcase and staring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
at Connie. &#8220;I can do anything but wait. But
that I just can&#8217;t do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we go over and call for Laura and
Vi?&#8221; Connie suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, they won&#8217;t be up yet,&#8221; said Billie hysterically,
then chuckled at Connie&#8217;s look of dismay. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean quite that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But Vi is
always late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I know we&#8217;d better go over!&#8221; said Connie,
going over and giving her hat one last little pat before
the mirror.
</p>
<p>But Billie had walked over to the window, and
now she called out excitedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come now,&#8221; she reported, adding
with a chuckle: &#8220;And there&#8217;s poor Teddy in the rear
carrying two suitcases and something that looks
like a lunch box. Come on, let&#8217;s go down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And down they went, taking two steps at a time.
Billie opened the door just as the two girls and
Teddy came up the steps. Chet, who had run out,
attracted by the noise, and was looking over Billie&#8217;s
shoulder, caught sight of Teddy and the load he
carried and emitted a whoop of joy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, old moving van!&#8221; he called. &#8220;So they&#8217;ve
got you doing it too, have they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Teddie set his load down on the steps and mopped
his perspiring brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And you&#8217;d better get busy yourself,&#8221; he
retorted, adding as Chet seemed about to protest:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some good news. Get your duds and I&#8217;ll
tell it to you on the way to the station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That got Chet started in a hurry, and a few minutes
later the young folks had said a loving good-bye
to Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, and were off, bag and
baggage, for the station.
</p>
<p>The girls&#8217; trunks had been sent down the day
before, so that all they had to do was to check them
at the station. Connie, of course, had had her
trunk checked right through to the station nearest
their destination.
</p>
<p>Chet clamored for Teddy&#8217;s news, and excitedly
Teddy showed him the letter from Paul Martinson
saying that the &#8220;old boat&#8221; would be ready to sail
in a few days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; cried Chet joyfully, trying to wave a
suitcase in the air and nearly dropping it on his toe
instead. &#8220;Say, girls, you may see us even before
you hoped to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoped to!&#8221; sniffed Laura. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hate
yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; cried Billie, her eyes shining.
&#8220;It will be a lark to have you boys drop in on us
some morning when we don&#8217;t expect you. Oh, it&#8217;s
just grand! We&#8217;ll be sure to be watching for all
of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rejoicing was cut short by the arrival of the
train a few minutes later. The girls scurried excitedly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
on board, the boys handing in their suitcases
after them.
</p>
<p>As the train started to move Teddy ran along the
platform with it and suddenly thrust something into
Billie&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for those currents,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re
awfully dangerous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he dropped back to join Chet, Billie looked
down at the thing in her hand. It was a package of
chocolate.
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>PLEASURE DRAWS NEAR</h3>
</div>

<p>As she looked, a flush stole over Billie&#8217;s face and
she tried hastily to hide the chocolate in the pocket
of her suit before the girls could see it.
</p>
<p>She would have succeeded if Vi had not accidentally
touched her elbow at that moment, knocking
the package of chocolate from her hand and
into the aisle of the car where it lay, face up, accusingly.
</p>
<p>Billie stretched out an eager hand for it, but
Laura was just before her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; she cried triumphantly, waving the little
brown rectangle aloft. &#8220;Candy! Where&#8217;d you get
it, Billie Bradley?&#8221; She turned swiftly upon Billie,
whose face was the color of a particularly gorgeous
beet. Vi and Connie looked on delightedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! anybody would think it was a crime
to have candy,&#8221; cried Billie indignantly. &#8220;You give
it to me, Laura, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She made a grab for her
property, but Laura snatched it back out of her
reach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, putting her hands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
behind her determinedly. &#8220;Not till you tell us where
you got it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;m not going to,&#8221; said Billie crossly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
none of your business.&#8221; And she turned away and
looked steadily out of the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it back to her, Laura,&#8221; begged Vi. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t fair to tease her so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, she shouldn&#8217;t tease so beautifully,&#8221;
Laura retorted, as, relenting, she slipped Teddy&#8217;s
gift back into Billie&#8217;s pocket.
</p>
<p>At that moment they were startled by a fearful
racket&mdash;a sound as if all the South Sea pirates that
had ever been born had gathered together and were
all quarreling at once.
</p>
<p>There was a great craning of necks as startled
passengers tried to see what it was all about and
the girls fairly jumped from their seats&mdash;for the
racket sounded in their very ears.
</p>
<p>Across the aisle from them there was a parrot&mdash;a
great green and red parrot that at that moment was
hanging by its claws to the roof of its cage and was
still emitting the raucous squawks that sounded like
the talking of a hundred pirates all rolled into one.
</p>
<p>An elderly woman who looked as if she might
be a spinster of the type generally known as &#8220;old
maid&#8221; was doing her best to silence the bird while
she fished wildly in her bag for something.
</p>
<p>She found what she was looking for&mdash;a heavy
black cloth, and, with a sigh of relief, flung it across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
the cage. Immediately the parrot&#8217;s uproar subsided
to a muttering and a moment later stopped altogether.
</p>
<p>Passengers who had craned their necks dropped
back in their seats chuckling, picked up magazines
or papers or whatever they had been reading where
they had left off, and peace settled over the car
again. For all save the girls, that is.
</p>
<p>For the elderly woman&mdash;who most certainly <i>was</i>
an old maid&mdash;had been terribly embarrassed over
the bird&#8217;s outbreak and began explaining to the girls
how she happened to have it in her possession, what
troubles she had already had with it, how glad she
would be when she delivered the bird to her brother,
who was its rightful owner, and so on until the
girls became desperate enough to throw things at
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there some way we can stop her!&#8221; whispered
Vi in Connie&#8217;s ear, while Billie and Laura
were listening to the woman&#8217;s chatter with forced
smiles and polite &#8220;yeses and nos.&#8221; &#8220;If I have to
listen to that voice another minute I&#8217;ll scream&mdash;I
know I shall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to stop her that I can think of,&#8221;
Connie whispered back, &#8220;would be to take the cover
off the parrot&#8217;s cage. He would drown out most
anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This kept up practically all morning with the
owner of the parrot talking on tirelessly and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
girls trying to listen politely until lunch time came.
</p>
<p>Thankfully they made their way through the
swaying train to the dining car and sat themselves
gratefully down at a little table set for four.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness we&#8217;ve escaped,&#8221; sighed Billie,
as her eyes wandered eagerly down the bill of fare,
for Billie was very hungry. &#8220;What will you have,
girls? I could eat everything on the card without
stopping to breathe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they returned to their car after lunch they
found to their relief that the talkative old woman
was gathering up her things as if about to change
cars at the junction&mdash;which was the next stop.
</p>
<p>She did get out at the junction, parrot and all,
and the girls fairly hugged each other in their delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old thing,&#8221; said Billie as the train swung
out from the station and the parrot cage disappeared.
&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she added after a moment,
&#8220;if I&#8217;ll ever get like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; scoffed Vi, with a fond glance at Billie&#8217;s
lovely face. &#8220;Yes, you look a lot like an old maid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t Teddy give her candy this morning?&#8221;
added Laura, with a wicked glance at Billie,
who said not a word, but stared steadily out of the
window.
</p>
<p>They bought magazines and tried to read them,
but finally gave up the attempt. What was the use
of reading about other people&#8217;s adventures when a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
far more thrilling one was in store for them at
Lighthouse Island?
</p>
<p>Billie said something like this, but Connie shook
her head doubtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re going to have any adventures,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t so very much to
do besides swimming and rowing in Uncle Tom&#8217;s
rowboat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, isn&#8217;t that enough?&#8221; said Billie, turning
on her. &#8220;Why, just being at the seashore is an
adventure. Just think, I&#8217;ve never in my life been
inside a really truly lighthouse. It&#8217;s going to be
just wonderful, Connie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And aren&#8217;t the boys coming in their motor boat,
too?&#8221; added Vi eagerly. &#8220;Why, they will probably
take us for a sail around the point and everything.
Connie, how can you say we&#8217;re not going to have
any adventures?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Connie laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot. I&#8217;ll take it
all back. And there&#8217;s Uncle Tom&#8217;s clam chowder,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;People come from all over just to
taste it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it, Laura?&#8221; asked Billie, turning
from the window suddenly and tapping nervously
on the window sill. &#8220;It won&#8217;t take us very much
longer to get there, will it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only three hours,&#8221; answered Laura, consulting
her wrist watch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Only three hours!&#8221; groaned Billie. &#8220;And I
thought we were nearly there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for a little while after that
while the girls took up their magazines again and
turned the pages listlessly. At the end of another
half hour they gave up the attempt entirely and
leaned their heads wearily against the backs of the
seats, fixing their eyes upon the ever-changing
scenery that fled past them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to form our Detective Club?&#8221;
asked Connie suddenly out of the silence.
</p>
<p>The girls stared at her a minute as if she had
roused them out of sleep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness sake, what made you think of that
now?&#8221; asked Laura a little peevishly. &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired
I don&#8217;t want to form clubs or anything else. All I
want is to get out somewhere where I can stretch my
legs, get some supper, and go to bed. I&#8217;m dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making lots of noise for a dead one,&#8221;
chuckled Billie, and Laura made a face at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But no one&#8217;s answered my question,&#8221; broke in
Connie plaintively. &#8220;I thought you girls loved mysteries
and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who says we don&#8217;t?&#8221; cried Laura. &#8220;Just
show me a good live mystery and I&#8217;ll forget I&#8217;m all
tied up in knots and everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just listen to her!&#8221; exclaimed Connie indignantly.
&#8220;Do you mean to say you&#8217;ve forgotten that
we have a mystery already?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;that,&#8221; said Laura slowly, while a light began
to dawn. &#8220;Yes, I did forget about it; we&#8217;ve
been so busy getting ready and everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t forgotten about it,&#8221; said Billie,
sitting up suddenly, while her cheeks began to glow
pink. &#8220;And the more I think about it, the funnier
it seems to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, everything,&#8221; answered Billie, getting more
excited as she spoke. &#8220;Hugo Billings in the first
place. And then finding Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album in
the woods. And the children. Girls, I&#8217;m just sure
they are mysteries&mdash;and real ones, too.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE LIGHT ON LIGHTHOUSE ISLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Laura looked faintly excited for a minute, then
she leaned back wearily in her seat again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just as sure as you are, Billie, that there&#8217;s
something funny about it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But if we
really had wanted to solve the mystery, we should
have stayed at Three Towers. The first thing they
do in detective stories is to shadow the people they
suspect. And how can we do that, I&#8217;d like to know,
when we&#8217;re running straight away from them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was very good reasoning. Even Billie and
Connie had to admit that, and they began to look
worried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t have asked you girls to
visit me. Then you might have stayed at Three
Towers for the summer and solved the mystery.
Now I&#8217;ve spoiled all the fun&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie! don&#8217;t be such an absolute goose,&#8221; cried
Billie, putting a hand over Connie&#8217;s mouth. &#8220;Do
you suppose we&#8217;d have missed this for anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; added Vi hopefully, &#8220;we may find
some more mysteries on Lighthouse Island.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; grumbled Laura, who was feeling
tired and cross, &#8220;you talk as if mysteries were just
hanging around loose begging to be found.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think maybe we&#8217;ll manage to enjoy ourselves,
even without mysteries,&#8221; said Billie gayly.
Nevertheless, she could not help thinking to herself:
&#8220;Oh, dear, I do wish there was some way
I could find out about Miss Arbuckle and those
lovely children and poor lonely, sad Hugo Billings.
I should like to help if I only knew how!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie, wake up! Wake up&mdash;it&#8217;s time to get off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She must have been very sound asleep because it
was several seconds before she fought her way
through a sea of unconsciousness and opened heavy
eyes upon a scene of confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she asked sleepily, but
some one, she thought it was Laura, shook her impatiently,
and some one else&mdash;she was wide awake
enough now to be sure this was Vi&mdash;put a hat on
her head and pushed it so far over her eyes that
she temporarily went blind again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness sake, can&#8217;t you put it on straight?&#8221;
she demanded indignantly, pushing the hat back
where it belonged. &#8220;What do you think you&#8217;re
doing anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little anger was the best thing that could have
come to Billie. It was about the only thing in the
world that would have gotten her wide awake just
then. And it was very necessary that she should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
be wide awake, for the train was just drawing into
the station where they were to get off to take the
boat to Lighthouse Island.
</p>
<p>She took the bag thrust into her hands by Laura,
and the girls hurried out into the aisle that was
crowded with people. A minute more, and they
found themselves on a platform down which people
hurried and porters rolled their baggage trucks and
where every one seemed intent upon making as
much noise as possible.
</p>
<p>Billie and Laura and Vi felt very much bewildered,
for they had never done any traveling except
in the company of some older person; but with a
confidence that surprised them, Connie took command
of the situation. For Connie had traveled
this route several times, and everything about it
was familiar to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your trunk checks,&#8221; she ordered, adding,
as the girls obediently fumbled in their pocketbooks:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hustle if we want to get our
trunks straightened out and get on board ourselves
before the boat starts. What&#8217;s the matter, Vi, you
haven&#8217;t lost your check, have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For one terrible minute Vi had been afraid she
had done just this, but now, with a sigh of relief,
she produced the check and handed it over to
Connie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but that was a narrow escape,&#8221; she murmured,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
as they hurried down the crowded platform.
</p>
<p>The boat that plied from the mainland to Lighthouse
Island and one or two more small islands
scattered about near the coast was a small but tidy
little vessel that was really capable of better speed
than most people gave her credit for. She was
painted a sort of dingy white, and large black letters
along her bow proclaimed her to be none other
than the <i>Mary Ann</i>.
</p>
<p>And now as the girls, with several other passengers,
stepped on board and felt the cool breeze
upon their faces they breathed deep of the salty air
and gazed wonderingly out over the majestic ocean
rolling on and on in unbroken swells toward the
distant horizon.
</p>
<p>Gone was all the fatigue of the long train ride.
They forgot that their lungs were full of soft coal
dirt, that their hands were grimy, and their faces,
too. They were completely under the spell of that
great, mysterious tyrant&mdash;the ocean.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this grand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just smell the salt air!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes you feel braced up already,&#8221; came from
Billie, who had been filling her lungs to the utmost.
&#8220;Oh, girls! I&#8217;m just crazy to jump in and have
a swim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you on that,&#8221; broke out Vi. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m
sure we&#8217;re going to have just the best times ever!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>There was a fair-sized crowd to get aboard, made
up partly of natives and partly of city folks. The
passengers were followed by a number of trunks
and a small amount of freight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently we&#8217;re not the only ones to take this
trip,&#8221; remarked Billie, as she noted the people coming
on board the <i>Mary Ann</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of these people must live on the islands
the year around,&#8221; said Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, how lonely it must be on this coast during
the winter months,&#8221; said Billie. &#8220;Think of being
out on one of those islands in a howling snowstorm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how they get anything to eat during
those times?&#8221; questioned Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume they keep stuff on hand,&#8221; answered
Billie.
</p>
<p>With a sharp toot of her whistle the boat moved
out from the dock, made her way carefully among
the numerous other craft in the harbor, and finally
nosed her way out into the water of the channel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O&mdash;oh,&#8221; breathed Vi, softly. &#8220;It&#8217;s even more
wonderful than I thought it would be. I&#8217;d like to
go sailing on and on like this forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Laura practically. &#8220;Not
without any supper. I&#8217;m getting a perfectly awful
appetite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be worse than that after you&#8217;ve been here
a little while,&#8221; laughed Connie. &#8220;Mother says that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
it seems as if she never can give me enough to eat
when we come out to the seashore, so she has given
up trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your poor mother!&#8221; said Billie dolefully. &#8220;And
now she has four of us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; chuckled Connie. &#8220;Mother was worrying
a little about that&mdash;as to how she could keep
four famished wolves fed at one time. But Uncle
Tom said he&#8217;d help her out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Uncle Tom,&#8221; Vi repeated wonderingly.
&#8220;Can he cook?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Connie, looking at her as if she
had asked if the world was square. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell
you about his clam chowder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Vi thoughtfully, while something
within her began to cry out for a sample of that
clam chowder. &#8220;Oh yes, I remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie, you&#8217;re cruel,&#8221; moaned Laura. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you talk of something besides clam chowder when
you know I&#8217;m starving to death? Goodness, I can
almost smell it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the clams you smell,&#8221; chuckled Connie.
&#8220;They always have some on board the <i>Mary Ann</i>
to sell to the islanders&mdash;if they haven&#8217;t the sense to
catch them themselves. We never need to buy any,&#8221;
she added, proudly. &#8220;Uncle Tom keeps us supplied
with all we want. Look!&#8221; she cried suddenly, pointing
to a small island which loomed directly ahead of
them, looking in the grey mist of evening like only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
a darker shadow against the shifting background.
&#8220;That&#8217;s our island&mdash;see? And there&#8217;s the light,&#8221;
she added, as a sudden beacon flashed out at them,
sending a ruddy light out over the dark water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it beautiful!&#8221; cried Billie rapturously.
&#8220;Just think what it must mean to the ships out at
sea&mdash;that friendly light, beckoning to them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t&mdash;beckon, I mean,&#8221; said Connie
decidedly. &#8220;That&#8217;s just what it isn&#8217;t for. It&#8217;s to
warn them to keep away or they&#8217;ll be sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there so much danger?&#8221; asked Laura eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say there is,&#8221; Connie answered gravely.
&#8220;In a storm especially. You see, the water is very
shallow around here and if a big ship runs in too
close to shore she&#8217;s apt to get on a shoal. That isn&#8217;t
so bad in clear weather&mdash;although a ship did get
stuck on the shoal here not so very long ago and
she was pretty much damaged when they got her
off. But in a storm&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried Billie impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Uncle Tom says,&#8221; Connie was very serious,
&#8220;that if a ship were driven upon the shoal in a
gale&mdash;and we have terrible storms around here&mdash;it
would probably come with such force that its bottom
would be pretty nearly crushed in and the people
on board might die before any one could get out
there to rescue them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Connie, how dreadful!&#8221; cried Vi. Laura
and Billie only stared at the lighthouse tower as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
though fascinated, while the little boat came steadily
nearer to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has anything like that ever happened here, Connie?&#8221;
asked Laura in an awed voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Connie. &#8220;There was a terrible wreck
here a long time ago&mdash;before they built the lighthouse.
But Uncle Tom says no one will ever know
just how many lives have been saved because of the
good old light. To hear him talk to it you would
think it was alive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; cried Billie, pointing excitedly as the
great white globe that held the light swung slowly
around toward them. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see that? It
winked at us!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>CONNIE'S MOTHER</h3>
</div>

<p>The steamer scraped against the dock and the
girls straightened their hats, picked up their suitcases,
and started down the narrow winding stairs
that led to the lower deck.
</p>
<p>Connie led the way as she had done ever since
they had left North Bend. She scrambled quickly
out upon the pier and the chums, following more
slowly, were in time to see Connie rapturously embrace
first a lady and then a gentleman standing
near by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; a deep masculine voice was saying,
&#8220;it seems mighty good to see our girl again. But
where are the others?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Connie turned eagerly to the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my mother and father, Billie and Laura
and Vi,&#8221; she said, with a proud wave of her hand
toward her smiling parents, who came forward and
greeted the girls cordially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too dark to see your faces,&#8221; Mrs. Danvers
said. &#8220;But Connie has described you to us so many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
times that it isn&#8217;t at all necessary. I&#8217;m sure I know
just exactly what you look like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but they&#8217;re three times as nice as anything
I&#8217;ve said about them,&#8221; Connie was protesting when
her father, who had been conversing with the captain
of the <i>Mary Ann</i>, stepped up to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you young ladies will give me your checks,&#8221;
he said&mdash;and the girls knew they were going to love
him because his voice sounded so kind&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend
to your trunks and you can go on up to the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls produced their checks, Mr. Danvers
went back to the captain, and Mrs. Danvers and
the girls started off in high spirits toward the bungalow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you very tired?&#8221; Mrs. Danvers asked them,
and the turn of her head as she looked at them made
the girls think of some pert, plump, cheery little
robin.
</p>
<p>It was really getting very dark, and the girls could
not make out what she looked like, but they could
see that she was small and graceful and her voice&mdash;well,
her voice had a gay lilt that made one want to
laugh even though all she said was &#8220;what a pleasant
day it is.&#8221; No wonder, with that father and mother,
Connie was such a darling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, we&#8217;re not very tired,&#8221; Billie said in
answer to Mrs. Danvers&#8217; question. &#8220;We were on
the train, but the minute we got on board the boat
we seemed to forget all about it. It&#8217;s this beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
salt air, I suppose,&#8221; and she sniffed happily at the
soft, salt-laden breeze that came wandering up from
the sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s the air,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Danvers
gayly. &#8220;The air does all sorts of wonderful things
to us. You just wait a few days and see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were walking along a rough boardwalk set
quite a way back from the water&#8217;s edge so that there
was a white stretch of beach between it and the first
thin line of lapping waves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, look at the boardwalk!&#8221; cried Laura, in
wonder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t say anything about a boardwalk
down here, Connie,&#8221; added Vi. &#8220;You&#8217;re really right
up to date, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you suppose?&#8221; put in Billie. &#8220;That
Lighthouse Island was in the backwoods and had
no improvements?&#8221; And she laughed gayly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know that very few of the islands on
this coast have boardwalks,&#8221; defended Laura. &#8220;Most
of them have the roughest kind of stony paths.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, there,&#8221; said Connie. &#8220;I remember
only too well when I was on Chatter Island we had
to climb over the rocks all the way, and one day I
twisted my ankle most dreadfully&mdash;so badly, in fact,
that I was laid up for three days while all the other
girls were having the best time ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I&#8217;d do on a real dark night,&#8221; remarked
Billie dryly. &#8220;If I couldn&#8217;t see where I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
stepping, I&#8217;d take my chances and walk in the sand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do that myself sometimes,&#8221; answered Connie.
</p>
<p>Several bungalows dotted the rather barren landscape,
for Lighthouse Island was an ideal spot for
a summer home&mdash;that is if one liked the seashore.
</p>
<p>But the girls were not so much interested in what
was on the island as they were in what was beyond
it. The ocean&mdash;the great dark, mysterious ocean
drew their eyes irresistibly and set their minds to
wandering. And as the days passed they were to
feel the spell of it more and more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; Mrs. Danvers said cheerily, and
with an effort the girls brought their thoughts back
to the present.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Danvers had turned from the main boardwalk
down another that led to a bungalow whose
every window was cheerfully and invitingly lighted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful where you step,&#8221; Mrs. Danvers called
back to them, and the girls saw that she was picking
her steps very carefully. &#8220;There are two or
three boards missing, and I can&#8217;t get Mr. Danvers
to do the repairing. He spends whole days,&#8221; she
added, turning plaintively to Connie, &#8220;up in that
old lighthouse just talking to your Uncle Tom. I
don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s your Uncle Tom&#8217;s conversation
he finds so fascinating or his clam chowder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She opened the door as she spoke and the girls
had a vision of a comfortable, gayly lighted room
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
all wicker chairs and chintz cushions and chintz
hangings, a room pretty and cozy, a room that
seemed to be beckoning and inviting the girls to
come in and make themselves at home.
</p>
<p>Which they did&mdash;immediately. All except Billie,
who stepped back a moment and gazed off through
the dusk to the light in the lighthouse tower glowing
its warning to the travelers over the dark highways
of the sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it,&#8221; she said, surprising herself by her
fervor. &#8220;It looks so bright and brave and lonely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she stepped in after the others and almost
ran into Connie, who was coming back to get her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing all by yourself out there
in the dark?&#8221; she asked accusingly. &#8220;We thought
you had run away or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, where would I run to?&#8221; asked Billie,
as they went upstairs together arm in arm. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no place to run except into the ocean, and I&#8217;d rather
wait for that till I have my bathing suit on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found Mrs. Danvers and Laura and Vi in a
large room as pretty and comfortable as the room
downstairs, though not quite so elaborate. Laura
and Vi were busily engaged in making themselves
entirely at home.
</p>
<p>Laura had her hat off and was fixing her hair in
front of a mirror and Vi was hanging up her coat in
the closet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see there&#8217;s a connecting door between these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
two rooms,&#8221; Mrs. Danvers said in her pleasant
voice; &#8220;so that you girls can feel almost as if you
were in one room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then as she caught sight of Billie and Connie in
the doorway she beckoned to them and disappeared
into the next room, and with a laughing word to
Laura and Vi they followed her.
</p>
<p>This was the room that she and Connie were to
occupy, Billie found, and she looked about her at
the handsome mahogany furniture and dainty dressing
table fixings with interest.
</p>
<p>But she was even more interested in seeing what
Connie&#8217;s mother looked like in the light. She was
not a bit disappointed, for Mrs. Danvers&#8217; looks entirely
matched her voice.
</p>
<p>Her eyes were a wide laughing hazel, set far apart
and fringed with dark lashes. Her hair, for she had
not worn a hat, was a soft brown, and the night
wind had whipped a pretty color into her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is awfully pretty. Not as pretty as my
mother,&#8221; Billie thought loyally, &#8220;but awfully pretty
just the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie must have been staring more than she
knew, for suddenly Mrs. Danvers&mdash;it seemed absurd
to call her &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; she looked so like a girl&mdash;turned
upon her and took her laughingly by the
shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re Billie Bradley,&#8221; she said, her hazel
eyes searching Billie&#8217;s brown ones. &#8220;Connie said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
you were the most popular girl at Three Towers
and that all the girls loved you. I can&#8217;t say that I
blame them, my dear,&#8221; giving Billie&#8217;s flushed cheek
a gay little pat. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very sure but what I may
do it myself. Now here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And she went on
to give directions while Billie followed her with
wondering eyes. How could a woman who was old
enough to be Connie&#8217;s mother look so absolutely and
entirely like a girl of twenty? She was not even
dignified like most of the mothers Billie knew&mdash;she
did not even try to be. Connie treated her as
she would an older and much loved sister. One
only needed to be with them three minutes to see
that mother and daughter adored each other and
were the very best chums in the world. And right
then and there Billie began adoring too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll run downstairs and get something on
the table for you girls to eat, for I know you must
be starving,&#8221; said Mrs. Danvers, or rather &#8220;Connie&#8217;s
mother,&#8221; as Billie called her from that day on.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop to fix up, girls, for there won&#8217;t be a
soul here to-night but Daddy and me&mdash;and we don&#8217;t
care. Hurry now. If you are not downstairs by
the time I have dinner on the table I&#8217;ll eat it all myself,
every bit.&#8221; With that she was gone into the
next room, leaving a trail of laughter behind her
that made Billie&#8217;s heart laugh in sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie,&#8221; she said, sitting down on the edge of
the bed and regarding her chum soberly as she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
opened her bag and drew out a brush and comb,
&#8220;I&#8217;m simply crazy about your mother. She&#8217;s so
young and pretty and&mdash;and&mdash;happy. Does she ever
do anything but laugh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not often,&#8221; said Connie, adding with a little
chuckle: &#8220;But when she does stop laughing you&#8217;d
better look out for 'breakers ahead,' as Uncle Tom
says. Mother&#8217;s French you know, and she has a
temper&mdash;about once a year. But for goodness sake,
stop talking, Billie, and get ready. You&#8217;ve got a
patch of dirt under one eye. What&#8217;s that I smell?
It&#8217;s clam chowder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clam chowder,&#8221; repeated Billie weakly. &#8220;Are
you sure it&#8217;s clam chowder, Connie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, clam chowder,&#8221; repeated Connie firmly.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>CLAM CHOWDER AND SALT AIR</h3>
</div>

<p>Connie was right, gloriously right. It was clam
chowder&mdash;the kind of clam chowder one dreams
about&mdash;come true. Uncle Tom had made it just
that very afternoon and had brought it over in a
huge bucket that was always used for such occasions.
</p>
<p>The girls ate and ate and ate and then ate some
more until they were completely satisfied with life
and were feeling contented and beautifully, wonderfully
drowsy.
</p>
<p>Connie&#8217;s mother had served them other things
beside clam chowder. There were pork chops and
apple sauce, there were muffins and honey and apple
pie, and when they had finished, the once full table
looked as if a swarm of locusts had been at it.
</p>
<p>And all the time Connie&#8217;s mother had watched
them with wide, delighted eyes and Connie&#8217;s father
had lounged back in his chair, smoking a cigar and
looking on with an indulgent smile.
</p>
<p>Mr. Danvers, with the aid of a couple of men
from the dock, had got the girls&#8217; trunks up to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
house and into the rooms they were going to occupy
for the summer.
</p>
<p>And now, having done his duty, he had sauntered
into the dining room to get acquainted with the girls
and smoke a cigar. He and Mrs. Danvers had had
their dinner earlier, because, as Mrs. Danvers laughingly
explained, &#8220;she had been famished and could
not wait,&#8221; so that now there was nothing to do but
watch the girls enjoy themselves.
</p>
<p>The dining room was like all the other rooms in
the cottage, cheerful and cozy and tastefully furnished,
and as the girls looked about them happily
they felt that they must have known the house and
its owners all their lives.
</p>
<p>Mr. Danvers was many years older than his wife,
and he looked even older than he was. But he was
a handsome man, and the touch of gray in the hair
at his temples only made him look more distinguished.
He adored his wife, and his eyes followed
her wherever she went.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As if any one could blame him for that,&#8221;
thought Billie, as Mrs. Danvers slipped a second
piece of apple pie on her plate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious! do you expect me to eat a second
piece of pie?&#8221; cried Billie, glancing up at Mrs.
Danvers, with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A second piece of pie isn&#8217;t very much for a
young girl with a healthy appetite,&#8221; returned the
lady of the bungalow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You give her too much pie, and she&#8217;ll be dreaming
of all sorts of things,&#8221; remonstrated Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Vi! To talk that way when you are eating
a second piece yourself!&#8221; broke in Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we dream, perhaps we&#8217;ll all dream together,
so what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; remarked Billie; and at
this there was a laugh in which even Mr. Danvers
joined.
</p>
<p>After dinner Connie&#8217;s mother sent them up to
their rooms, saying that she knew they must be tired
to death and should go to bed early so they could
get up to see the sun rise the next morning.
</p>
<p>They did not protest very much, for they were
tired and the prospect of bed was very alluring.
To-morrow&mdash;well, to-morrow they would go exploring.
Perhaps they might even be permitted to
visit the lighthouse and Uncle Tom. Speaking of
Uncle Tom made Billie think of the clam chowder,
and although she could not have eaten another scrap
if she had tried, her mouth watered at the memory.
</p>
<p>The girls left the connecting door open between
the two rooms so that they could talk to each other
if they wanted to, but they did not do very much
talking that night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this feels good,&#8221; sighed Billie, as Connie
turned down the covers and she crawled thankfully
into bed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was so awfully tired.
And that dinner! Connie, does your mother always
serve dinners like that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Connie, flinging her thick braid over
her shoulder and crossing the room to turn out the
light. &#8220;Mother&#8217;s an awfully good cook, and although
we have a maid to do the heavy work
Mother does all the cooking herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Billie, snuggling down under the
covers luxuriously as Connie joined her, &#8220;I&#8217;m
mighty glad I came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we don&#8217;t solve any mysteries?&#8221; asked
Connie, a trifle wistfully.
</p>
<p>Billie turned over and tried to see her face, a
thing impossible, of course, in the dark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a foolish thing to say,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
shake you, Connie Danvers, if you ever say a thing
like that again. We could have stayed at Three
Towers if we had wanted to solve mysteries more
than we wanted to come here, couldn&#8217;t we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Connie doubtfully. &#8220;Only, of
course, we didn&#8217;t know anything about the mystery
when I asked you to come here. So you couldn&#8217;t
have backed out very well, even if you had wanted
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie turned over impatiently and caught Connie
by the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie Danvers!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;now I know you
want to be shaken. Are you really trying to say
that we didn&#8217;t want to come with you and only
did it to please you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Connie, with a shake of her head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
&#8220;Of course I didn&#8217;t mean just that. Just the same,&#8221;
she added longingly, &#8220;I am awfully anxious to find
out about Miss Arbuckle and her album and&mdash;that
strange man&mdash;everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was then that a horrible thought struck Billie,
and it was so horrible that it sat her straight up
in bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie&mdash;I just thought&mdash;could it&mdash;were you
sorry you asked us to come?&#8221; she stammered.
&#8220;Would you rather have stayed at Three Towers
yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a minute there was silence and Billie knew
that Connie was staring through the dark at her
in absolute amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You perfectly silly goose,&#8221; said Connie then,
her bewilderment changing to indignation. &#8220;Now
I know who wants to be shaken. Lie down here,
Billie, and see if you can act sensibly. Sorry I
asked you!&#8221; she exploded indignantly. &#8220;Why, who
ever heard of such a thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said you wanted to solve the mystery&mdash;if
there is one,&#8221; Billie reminded her, lying down
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course I do. So do all the rest of
you,&#8221; Connie shot back. &#8220;But as to being sorry
I asked you, why, I&#8217;ve a good mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She rose
threateningly in the bed and Billie put out a pleading
hand, saying with a chuckle:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t kill me or do whatever you were
going to. I take it all back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say you&#8217;d better!&#8221; sputtered Connie,
coming down with a thump in the bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you girls raving about?&#8221; asked a
sleepy voice from the next room that they recognized
as Vi&#8217;s. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you keep still and let a fellow
sleep? Laura&#8217;s snoring already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am not!&#8221; came indignantly from Laura.
&#8220;I never snore!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Vi with interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Know!&#8221; sputtered Laura. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know
how I know, but I do know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are like an aunt of mine,&#8221; Vi&#8217;s
voice came lazily back. &#8220;She says she knows she
never snores because she stayed awake all night
once just to see if she did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie and Connie chuckled, which would have
made Laura more indignant if she had not been so
sleepy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for goodness sake, keep still and let me
sleep,&#8221; she cried, adding ferociously: &#8220;I saw a
knife around somewhere downstairs. If anybody
speaks another word I&#8217;m going down and get it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whether this threat had anything to do with it
or not, it would be hard to say. But at any rate
the girls did stop talking and settled down for
sleep.
</p>
<p>All but one of them succeeded in drifting off into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the land of nod in no time at all, but that one of
them&mdash;who was Billie&mdash;lay for a long time with
eyes wide open staring into the dark.
</p>
<p>Then gradually the soft lapping of waves upon
the beach soothed her into a sort of doze where
tall thin men and shabby picture albums and queer
little huts were all confused and jumbled together.
Only one thing stood out clearly, and that was the
great searchlight, twinkling, winking, glowing,
sending its friendly message far out upon the sea.
</p>
<p>Then all the troubled visions disappeared in a
soft black cloud. Billie was asleep.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>FUN AND NONSENSE</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning the girls were up with the
sun. They were in hilarious spirits and made so
much noise that Mrs. Danvers, busily getting breakfast
in the kitchen below, smiled to herself and
hugged a big collie that at that moment strolled
leisurely into the room.
</p>
<p>The big collie&#8217;s name was Bruce, and he belonged
to Uncle Tom of the lighthouse. But although
Uncle Tom was his master and was first in his
dog&#8217;s heart, Connie&#8217;s mother was his very next
best beloved and Bruce spent his time nearly
equally between the lighthouse and Uncle Tom
and the cottage and Connie&#8217;s mother.
</p>
<p>Now he answered the woman&#8217;s hug with a loving
look from his beautiful eyes and waved his
brush gratefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce darling,&#8221; said Connie&#8217;s mother, as she
lifted a pan of biscuits and shoved it into the oven,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a perfectly gorgeous morning and a perfectly
gorgeous world and you&#8217;re a perfectly gorgeous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
dog. Now don&#8217;t deny it. You know you are! How
about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>To which Bruce responded by a more vigorous
waving of his white tipped brush that very nearly
swept a second pan of biscuits off on to the well-swept
floor.
</p>
<p>Connie&#8217;s mother rescued it with a quick motion
of her arm and stared at Bruce reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bruce, just suppose you had spoiled it!&#8221; she
scolded, as she slipped the pan into the oven after
its fellow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that I have four
hungry girls to feed, to say nothing of a great
big husband&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what are you saying about me?&#8221; asked a
man&#8217;s pleasant voice from the doorway, adding as
Connie&#8217;s mother turned toward him: &#8220;Can&#8217;t I
help, dear? You look rather warm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Warm! Well, I should say I was!&#8221; said Connie&#8217;s
mother, sweeping a stray lock of hair back
out of her eyes. &#8220;But what do I care when it&#8217;s
such a wonderful world? Haven&#8217;t I got my baby
back again, and three others as well? They&#8217;re sweet
girls, aren&#8217;t they, John? And Billie Bradley is
going to be a beauty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know some one else who is a beauty,&#8221;
said Mr. Danvers, looking admiringly at his wife&#8217;s
rosy face and wide-apart, laughing eyes, adding
with a smile: &#8220;Even though she has a big patch
of flour under one eye.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Connie&#8217;s mother, and wiped her
face vigorously with a pink and white checked
apron. &#8220;Now just for that,&#8221; she said, turning to
her husband, who was still lounging in the doorway,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put you out. And Bruce, too.
I have enough to do without having a husband
who makes fun of me and a dog who sticks his tail
into everything under my feet all the time. Hurry
on,&#8221; and she pushed her protesting, laughing husband
and the reluctant dog out through the open
door and into the brilliant sunshine beyond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to call us in time for breakfast?&#8221;
Mr. Danvers called back to his wife over his
shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send Connie
after you.&#8221; And she playfully waved a frying pan
at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She put us out, Bruce,&#8221; said Mr. Danvers laying
a caressing hand on the dog&#8217;s beautiful head as
he walked gravely along beside him. &#8220;But we love
her just the same, don&#8217;t we?&#8221; And Bruce&#8217;s answer
was to press close to Mr. Danvers and wave his tail
enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>Hardly had Mrs. Danvers had time to put the
bacon in the oven to keep warm and break the eggs
into the pan when there was a sound of skirmishing
on the stairs, and a moment later a whirlwind
broke in upon her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, Mother, Mother, everything smells
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
good!&#8221; cried Connie, dancing over to her mother
and hugging her so energetically that she almost
sent the eggs, pan and all, on the floor. &#8220;Is there
anything we can do to help?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;go away,&#8221; cried Connie&#8217;s mother, seeing
with dismay that one of the eggs in the pan was
broken&mdash;and Connie&#8217;s mother prided herself upon
serving perfect eggs. Then, as she saw the surprise
in the girls&#8217; faces, she relented, left the eggs to their
fate, and hugged them all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re darlings,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But you&#8217;re awfully
in the way. Billie, for goodness sake, hand
me that pancake turner. Quick! These eggs are
going to be awful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Billie had jumped to the rescue, and when
the eggs were turned out on the platter with the
bacon surrounding them on four sides, they did not
look &#8220;awful&#8221; at all, but just about the most appetizing
things the girls had ever laid hungry eyes
on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let me carry them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And to a chorus of a score or so other such
pleas, the eggs were borne triumphantly into the
dining room and set carefully on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the biscuits!&#8221; cried Connie, running back
into the kitchen where her mother was just heaping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
another platter high with golden brown deliciousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; said Connie, darting a kiss at
her mother that landed just exactly on the tip of
Mrs. Danvers&#8217; pretty astonished nose, &#8220;everything
you cook always looks just exactly like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she disappeared with the biscuits, leaving
her mother to rub her nose and smile somewhat
proudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it must have been a compliment,&#8221; she
chuckled, as she followed Connie with a second
plate of biscuits, &#8220;for they always seem to like what
I cook.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls were already waiting politely but impatiently
for her. She was about to sit down when
she thought of Mr. Danvers. She looked hastily at
Connie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told your father I&#8217;d send you after him when
breakfast was ready,&#8221; she said; and Connie looked
dismayed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I just know they&#8217;ll eat
all the biscuits before I get back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t. We promise,&#8221; said Billie; but
Connie still looked doubtful enough to make them
giggle as she flung out of the door in search of her
father.
</p>
<p>She had been gone scarcely two minutes when
she returned triumphantly with her father and
Bruce in tow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They were just coming back,&#8221; she told her
mother, as she sank into her seat and reached for
a biscuit. &#8220;Daddy said he smelled the biscuits
and they drew him with&mdash;&mdash;What was it you
said they drew you with, Daddy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Irresistible force?&#8221; asked Mr. Danvers, as he
greeted the girls and took his seat at the head of
the table. &#8220;Now, if they only taste as they smell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He smiled at his wife across the table and
she handed him a plate full of the golden brown
biscuits.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who owns the dog?&#8221; asked Laura boyishly, as
Bruce sat down gravely at Mrs. Danvers&#8217; side,
looking up at her adoringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, excuse me; I forgot to introduce
him,&#8221; cried Mrs. Danvers, dimpling and laying her
hand lightly on the dog&#8217;s head. &#8220;This is Robert
Bruce, and he&#8217;s a thoroughbred and belongs to
Uncle Tom, and lives over at the lighthouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The lighthouse,&#8221; repeated Billie eagerly, then
added as though she were thinking aloud: &#8220;Oh,
but I&#8217;m crazy to see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; asked Connie&#8217;s mother, looking surprised
at Billie&#8217;s eagerness, for the lighthouse was
an old story to her. &#8220;Connie can take you over
there to-day if you would like to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t that be lovely!&#8221; cried Vi. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
always wanted to see inside a real lighthouse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
I want to know all about the lights and everything.
When can we go, Mrs. Danvers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time you like,&#8221; answered Mrs. Danvers,
her heart warming to their girlish enthusiasm.
She was falling in love with Connie&#8217;s friends more
and more every minute. &#8220;Uncle Tom receives visitors
at all hours of the day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he has lots of &#8217;em,&#8221; added Connie, nodding
over her coffee cup. &#8220;All the children and the
men love him. He can tell so many stories, you
know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And fish stories too, I reckon,&#8221; put in Connie&#8217;s
mother laughingly. &#8220;You know you can never really
depend upon a sailor&#8217;s telling the truth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Good as the breakfast was, the girls found themselves
hurrying through it, so eager were they to
see the lighthouse and Uncle Tom. They took
Bruce with them at Mrs. Danvers&#8217; request, for she
was going to be very busy and the big dog did
have a habit of getting in the way.
</p>
<p>As the girls swung along the boardwalk they
had a wild desire to shout with the sheer joy of
living. Everything looked so different by daylight.
It was not half so thrilling and mysterious, but it
was much more beautiful.
</p>
<p>The ocean was calm, for there was almost no
wind. The water gleamed and sparkled in the
brilliant sunshine, and the beach was almost too
dazzlingly white to look upon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>In the distance rose the irregular outline of the
mainland, but on all other sides there was nothing
but an illimitable stretch of long, graceful, rolling
combers.
</p>
<p>As the girls came out upon the Point, there, before
them, rose the lighthouse tower, robbed of
the mystery it had worn the night before, yet wearing
a quaint, romantic dignity all its own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Connie,&#8221; said Billie happily, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure this is
the most wonderful place in the world.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>UNCLE TOM</h3>
</div>

<p>Uncle Tom was undeniably glad to see them.
He was sitting in the little room at the base of the
tower which was his living room, smoking a great
corn-cob pipe and idly turning over the pages of
a book.
</p>
<p>But as Connie entered and ran to him with a joyful
cry, he put the pipe down carefully, flung the
book on the floor and caught the girl in a bear&#8217;s
hug.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he cried, his great voice filling the
room like thunder, &#8220;here&#8217;s my little girl come back
to me again. I was beginning to think you&#8217;d deserted
your uncle in his old age, Connie, lass. When
did you get back? And who are these other very
pretty young ladies you have with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are my chums and the nicest girls in all
the world,&#8221; said Connie, turning to them gayly.
&#8220;You must have known they were coming, Uncle
Tom. Mother said she told you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, so she did,&#8221; said Uncle Tom in the
same hearty tones that seemed to fill the little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
room and&mdash;the girls could almost have sworn to it&mdash;make
it tremble. &#8220;But my memory is getting
worse and worse, Connie, lass,&#8221; he added, with a
doleful shake of the head that was belied by the
merry twinkle in his eyes. &#8220;Let me see now, what
was it their names were?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then laughingly Connie introduced the girls and
Uncle Tom had some funny personal little thing
to say to each one of them so that by the time the
introductions were over they were all laughing
merrily and feeling very well acquainted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you will be wanting to see the tower,&#8221;
said Uncle Tom, after he had shown them all
around the quaint little room and introduced them
to some of his treasures&mdash;queer racks and shells
and pebbles that he had picked up in his wanderings.
&#8220;Everybody always wants to climb the tower,
and it&#8217;s mighty hard on a poor old fellow with a
weak back, let me tell you.&#8221; And again the doleful
shake of the head was belied by the twinkle in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re in no hurry, please,&#8221; put in Billie,
turning from one of the small-paned, outward-opening
windows that looked straight out upon the
ocean. &#8220;I think this is the darlingest room I ever
saw. I could spend days and days just looking
around here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Connie&#8217;s Uncle Tom stood six feet two in his
stocking feet and was broad in proportion. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
had a shock of reddish brown hair that was becoming
slightly streaked with gray, but his face
was clean shaven. His features were rugged, rather
than handsome, but his eyes were large and red-brown
to match his hair and with an everlasting
humor in them that made everybody love him who
knew him.
</p>
<p>And now he stood looking down at Billie&#8217;s pretty,
eager face, and, though his face was grave, his
eyes were laughing as usual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I do. But then,
I have to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d want to,&#8221; Billie shot back.
&#8220;Why, I am sure I would just love to live here
myself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Uncle Tom interrupted, taking
up his pipe and puffing at it thoughtfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s
mighty nice in the day time, I&#8217;ll admit. Then it&#8217;s
a mighty pretty, homey place. But at night, especially
on a stormy night, it&#8217;s different. The wind
wails round here like a tortured ghost, the waves
beat upon the rock foundation of the tower like
savage beasts trying to tear it apart, and the tower
itself seems to quiver and tremble. And you start
to wonder&mdash;&#8221; the girls had gathered closer to
him, for his voice was grave and his eyes had
stopped laughing&mdash;&#8220;about the ships away out there
in the fury of the storm, some of them crippled,
distressed, sinking perhaps. And you get to thinking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
about the men and women, and little children
maybe, on board and wondering how many will be
alive when the storm dies down. I tell you it
grips you by the throat, it makes your eyes ache
with pity, and you curse the storm that&#8217;s bringing
disaster along with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hands were clenched, his face was hard and
stern, and the girls felt thrilled, stirred, as they
had never been before. But suddenly he jumped
to his feet, went over to the window and stood
there looking out for a moment. And when he
came back he was smiling so naturally that the girls
caught themselves wondering if they had not
dreamed what had gone before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to give you a lecture,&#8221; he told
them gayly. And with strange reluctance they
shook off the spell and smiled with him. &#8220;Come
on, let&#8217;s take a look at the tower, and then I&#8217;ll
give you some clam chowder. Would you like
some clam chowder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were too fresh from breakfast to be wildly
enthusiastic even over clam chowder just then, but
they knew the time would come soon when they
would be hungry again, so they assented happily
and followed the broad back of Uncle Tom up the
winding tower steps.
</p>
<p>They exclaimed over the tower room, and the
wonderful revolving light, but the thing that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
charmed them most was the platform that completely
encircled the tower.
</p>
<p>They reached the platform through a small door,
and as the girls stepped out upon it they felt almost
as if they were stepping out into space.
</p>
<p>The water seemed unbelievably far away, farther
a good deal than it actually was, and Billie did not
dare look down very long for fear of becoming
dizzy.
</p>
<p>It was almost half an hour before Uncle Tom
finally succeeded in luring them away from the
platform, and then the whole crowd of girls went
reluctantly.
</p>
<p>They went downstairs with Uncle Tom and listened
to his yarns, with Bruce curled happily up
at his master&#8217;s feet, until the thought of the clam
chowder he had promised them became insistent
and Connie asked him pointblank whether he had
forgotten all about it.
</p>
<p>Uncle Tom indignantly denied the latter imputation,
and set about preparing the chowder immediately,
the girls offering eager but inexperienced
help. Bruce tried to help, too, but only succeeded,
as usual, in getting himself in the way.
</p>
<p>And after that came bliss! The girls succeeded
in devouring a huge pot of delicious chowder&mdash;it
was better than that they had had the night before,
because it was freshly made&mdash;and it was after three
o&#8217;clock before they finally tore themselves from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
lighthouse and Uncle Tom and started for the Danvers'
bungalow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come again and come often,&#8221; he called after
them in his megaphone voice, one hand stroking
Bruce&#8217;s beautiful head as the big dog stood beside
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; they answered happily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially if you give us clam chowder every
time,&#8221; Billie laughed back at him over her shoulder.
&#8220;Good-bye, Bruce.&#8221; She turned once more before
they lost sight of the lighthouse keeper, and there he
was, towering in the doorway, his dog at his side,
smoking his corn cob pipe and gazing thoughtfully
out to sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you love him, Connie,&#8221; she said,
shading her eyes with her hand, for the brilliant
sunshine made her blink. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s wonderful.
He&#8217;s like&mdash;like&mdash;somebody out of a book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Teddy,&#8221; said Laura, with a wicked side
glance at her chum. &#8220;I guess he&#8217;d better hurry up,
if he&#8217;s coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie tried hard to think of something crushing
to say in reply, but before she could speak Connie
gave an excited little skip that very nearly landed
her in the sand a couple of feet below the boardwalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, when do you suppose the boys will get
here?&#8221; she asked eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;m just crazy to go
out in that motor boat of Paul&#8217;s.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to have the boys come will be all we need
to make us perfectly happy,&#8221; declared Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they ought to be along in a few days
now,&#8221; said Billie. Then she suddenly caught Connie&#8217;s
arm and pointed out toward the water&#8217;s edge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;There are some people in
swimming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; said Connie. &#8220;We can go in
swimming, too, to-morrow if we want to. Maybe
Uncle Tom will come along. I always feel safer
with him, he&#8217;s such a wonderful swimmer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so,&#8221; said Vi, adding plaintively: &#8220;I
only wish to-morrow wasn&#8217;t such a long way off,&#8221;
and she sighed.
</p>
<p>The girls walked along in silence for a few minutes.
Then Billie spoke as if she were thinking
aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what your Uncle Tom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better call him your Uncle Tom,&#8221; said
Connie, with a laugh, &#8220;because he&#8217;s already adopted
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Billie. &#8220;I wonder what made
Uncle Tom speak the way he did about storms and
wrecks and&mdash;and&mdash;things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, since he&#8217;s a sailor,&#8221; said Laura, &#8220;I suppose
he&#8217;s been in all sorts of wrecks, and of course
he thinks about them most in a storm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Connie gravely. &#8220;No, that isn&#8217;t it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
You see,&#8221; she lowered her voice a little and spoke
slowly, &#8220;Uncle Tom lost somebody in a wreck once.
She was a very lovely girl, it is said, and Uncle
Tom was engaged to marry her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls&#8217; young faces were very sober as they
gazed at Connie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Billie softly. &#8220;Now I see. Poor,
poor Uncle Tom!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S MOTOR BOAT</h3>
</div>

<p>The days flew by on wings and the girls were
surprised to wake one morning to find that they
had been at Lighthouse Island over a week.
</p>
<p>They had been bathing and boating and swimming
till they were tanned a beautiful brown, the
color not being confined to their faces, but covering
their arms and hands as well.
</p>
<p>What with the exercise and Mrs. Danvers&#8217; wonderful
cooking, they had gained flesh so fast that
they had begun to wonder a little anxiously if they
were &#8220;bound for the freak show.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s positively dreadful!&#8221; Laura declared
one morning, feeling ruefully of her waistline which
she was quite certain had expanded at least two
inches. &#8220;I&#8217;ve simply got to stop eating, or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop eating!&#8221; echoed Billie, taking up a handful
of sand and letting it sift slowly through her
fingers. &#8220;Well, maybe you can do it, Laura dear,
but I certainly can&#8217;t&mdash;not with Connie&#8217;s mother
doing the cooking.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to try, no matter how fat I get,&#8221;
declared Vi.
</p>
<p>It was right after breakfast, and the girls had
jumped into their bathing suits, as they did at almost
the same time every morning, and were waiting impatiently
for the hour to pass that Mrs. Danvers
had insisted must pass before they went in swimming
after breakfast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother said she might come down this morning
and go in with us,&#8221; said Connie, her eyes fixed
dreamily on the horizon. Then suddenly she sat
up straight and stared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Billie. &#8220;Seeing
ghosts or something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But look!&#8221; Connie clutched at her arm.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a motor boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8221; was a tiny spot that grew bigger as they
looked and seemed to be headed in their direction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a boat of some sort, I think,&#8221; said Vi. &#8220;But
you can&#8217;t tell whether it&#8217;s a motor boat or some
other kind of a craft.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can,&#8221; Laura broke in excitedly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be a motor boat because there aren&#8217;t
any sails or anything. It is! It is! Oh, girls!
could it be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys?&#8221; finished Billie, shading her eyes with
her hand and gazing eagerly out toward the speck
that was growing larger every minute. &#8220;Oh,
wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not a bit sure it&#8217;s the boys,&#8221; Connie
reminded her. &#8220;Lots of motor boats come here
in the summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stop being a kill-joy,&#8221; Laura commanded,
giving her a little shake. &#8220;I just feel it in my bones
that the boys are in that boat. Where will they
land, Connie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the dock, of course,&#8221; Connie answered, in
a tone which said very plainly: &#8220;You ought to
have known that without asking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s run around there then,&#8221; cried Billie,
her cheeks red with excitement. &#8220;They won&#8217;t know
what to do if nobody&#8217;s there to meet them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As always with Billie, to think a thing was to
do it, and before the girls had a chance to say
anything she was off, fleet-footed, down the sand
in the direction of the dock.
</p>
<p>The girls stared for a minute, then Laura started
in pursuit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;She&#8217;s crazy, of course,
but we&#8217;ve got to follow her, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie had almost reached the dock before they
caught up with her. Then Laura reached out a
hand and jerked her to stop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;be sensible for just a minute,
please. Suppose it isn&#8217;t the boys? Then we
won&#8217;t want to be waiting around as though we
wanted somebody to speak to us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but I&#8217;m sure it is the boys. You said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
so yourself,&#8221; retorted Billie impatiently, her eyes
fixed on the mysterious spot dancing and bobbing
on the glistening water. &#8220;And they certainly won&#8217;t
know what to do if there isn&#8217;t a soul here to meet
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t want to meet them in our bathing
suits,&#8221; said Vi, who, with Connie, had just come
pantingly up. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be just proper, would
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie looked at her doubtfully a moment, then
reluctantly shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose it would,&#8221; she admitted,
adding with a stamp of her foot. &#8220;But I did want
to be here to meet them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can be, if we rush,&#8221; broke in Connie.
&#8220;The boat won&#8217;t reach the dock for fifteen or
twenty minutes anyway, because it&#8217;s still a long way
off. We may be able to throw some clothes on
and be back by that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Throw&#8217; is right,&#8221; Laura said skeptically, but
Billie was already racing off again in the direction
of the cottage. With a helpless little laugh, the
girls followed.
</p>
<p>The boys would have declared it could not be
done. But the girls proved that it could. They
were panting when they reached the house, stopped
just long enough to explain to the surprised Mrs.
Danvers and then scurried upstairs, and with eager
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
fingers tore off their bathing suits and substituted
their ordinary clothes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good we didn&#8217;t go in bathing and get our
hair all wet,&#8221; Vi panted, but Laura put a hand over
her mouth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop talking,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;You need your
breath!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, they were pretty much out
of the last-named article when they reached the
dock again. But the great thing was that they
had succeeded in getting there before whoever was
in that motor boat made a landing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose after all this it isn&#8217;t the boys?&#8221; panted
Laura, and Connie gave her a funny glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill-joy,&#8221; she jeered, paying her back.
</p>
<p>Laura was about to retort, but Billie interrupted
with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop fighting, girls,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;and tell
me something. Is my hair on straight?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s too much over one eye,&#8221; replied Connie
in the same tone.
</p>
<p>Then Vi claimed their attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;They are coming around
the other side of the dock. Oh, isn&#8217;t that a perfectly
beautiful boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was, but the girls were just then too much
interested in finding out who was in the boat to
pay very much attention to its beauty. The graceful
craft swung around toward them, the motor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
was shut off, and the boat glided easily in to the
dock.
</p>
<p>The girls were standing a little way back, so as
not to appear too curious, and that was the reason
why the boys saw them before they saw the newcomers.
</p>
<p>There was a whoop from the deck of the motor
boat, a shout of, &#8220;Say, fellows, look who&#8217;s here!&#8221;
and the next moment three sportily clad young figures
leaped out on the dock and made a dash for
the girls, leaving the fourth member of their party
protesting vigorously.
</p>
<p>The fourth member was none other than Paul
Martinson, and, being the owner and captain of the
handsome motor boat, he had no intention of following
the other boys and leaving his craft to
wander out to sea.
</p>
<p>So he told the boys what he thought of them,
which did not do a particle of good since they did
not hear a word he said, and remained in the boat
while he held on to the dock with one hand.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Chet had hugged his sister and Teddy
had hugged his sister and Ferd had declared longingly
that he wished he had a sister to hug, it
made him feel lonesome, and there was laughter
and noise and confusion generally.
</p>
<p>It was Connie who reminded them of poor Paul
grumbling away all by himself in his boat, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
boys ran penitently over to him while the girls
danced after them joyfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a splendid boat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a beauty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What good times you must have in her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was really an unusually handsome craft, and
it was little wonder that Paul regarded it with
pride. He invited the girls on board, and they
went into raptures enough over it to satisfy even
him.
</p>
<p>It was a good fifty feet in length and had a cabin
in which one could stand up if one were not very
tall. There were bunks running along both sides
of the cabin that looked like leather-cushioned divans
in the daytime and could be turned into the
most comfortable of beds at night.
</p>
<p>There was a galley &#8220;for&#8217;ard,&#8221; too, where the
boys cooked their rather sketchy meals, and into
this the girls poked eagerly curious heads.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all just the completest thing I&#8217;ve ever
seen!&#8221; cried Billie, clapping her hands in delight
while Paul looked at her happily. &#8220;Those cunning
curtains at the window and&mdash;everything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother did that,&#8221; Paul admitted sheepishly,
as he followed the girls out on the deck. &#8220;And
I didn&#8217;t like to take them down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should say you wouldn&#8217;t take them
down!&#8221; said Connie indignantly. &#8220;The idea!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Don&#8217;t you dream of it! Why, they are just what
make the cabin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t this some deck! Did your mother do
this too, Paul?&#8221; asked Laura, her eyes traveling
admiringly from the pretty wicker lounging chairs
to the gayly striped awning and brilliant deck rail
that shown like gold in the dazzling sun. &#8220;Why,
Paul, I never knew a motor boat could be so pretty
and comfy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, but you ought to see her go!&#8221; put in Chet
eagerly. &#8220;She&#8217;s as fast a little boat as she is pretty.
Oh, she&#8217;s great!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it almost makes me wish I had done some
studying at school,&#8221; said Ferd Stowing, rubbing
his head ruefully. &#8220;Maybe if I had my dad would
have given me an aeroplane or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After they had fastened the boat securely to the
dock so that there was no danger of its floating off
they turned reluctantly away from the dock and
started off toward the Danvers&#8217; cottage.
</p>
<p>Then the girls tried to tell the boys all that had
happened since they had last met and the boys
tried to do the same, the result being hopeless confusion
and perfect happiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, make believe that beach doesn&#8217;t look good!&#8221;
exclaimed Teddy to Billie, for they had fallen a
little behind the rest. &#8220;And the good old ocean&mdash;say,
what a day for a swim!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what we were going to do when we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
saw you coming,&#8221; Billie confided, thinking how exceedingly
handsome he looked in his white trousers
and dark coat. Then she told him of the wild
scramble they had had to get dressed, and she looked
so pretty in the telling of it that he did not hear
much of what she was saying to him for looking at
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what made you so sure it was us?&#8221; asked
Teddy ungrammatically.
</p>
<p>Billie chuckled and gave a little skip of pure
happiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura said she felt it in her bones,&#8221; she said.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>OUT OF THE FOG</h3>
</div>

<p>That afternoon the boys and girls went in swimming
and that evening Connie&#8217;s mother treated them
all to a substantial dinner such as only she knew
how to cook.
</p>
<p>And the way it disappeared before those ravenous
girls and boys made even Mr. Danvers hold up
his hands in consternation. But Connie&#8217;s mother
laughed happily, pressed them to eat everything up,
&#8220;for it would only spoil,&#8221; and looked more than
ever like Connie&#8217;s older sister.
</p>
<p>That night the boys were put up in a spare room
which contained one bed and two cots which Connie&#8217;s
mother always kept stowed away for emergencies.
For the cottage on Lighthouse Island
was a popular place with Mrs. Danvers&#8217; relatives
and friends, and she often had unexpected company.
</p>
<p>They went out on the porch a little while after
supper, and the boys were at their funniest and
kept the girls in a continual gale of merriment.
</p>
<p>The time passed so quickly that before they knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
it eleven o&#8217;clock chimed out from the hall inside
and in consternation Connie&#8217;s mother hurried them
all off to bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow is another day,&#8221; she added with a
little smile.
</p>
<p>As they started up the stairs Teddy looked down
at Billie and said boyishly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Billie, you&#8217;ve got <i>some</i> sunburn, haven&#8217;t
you? You&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re mighty pretty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Teddy blushed and Billie blushed, and Billie
hoped with all her heart that Laura had not heard
it.
</p>
<p>Laura had not, for she was talking and laughing
with Paul Martinson and Connie. And so Billie,
running ahead and reaching her room first, turned
on the light and stepped over to the mirror.
</p>
<p>Was that Billie, she wondered, who gazed back
at her from the mirror? For this girl was surely
prettier than Billie ever had been. Her eyes were
shining, her cheeks were flushed under their tan,
and her hair, a little tumbled by the breeze from
the sea, made an unexpectedly pretty frame for a
very lovely face.
</p>
<p>The next day the girls insisted that the boys
take them out in their motor boat. The boys protested
a little, for the sun was acting rather queerly&mdash;going
under a cloud and staying there sometimes
for half an hour on a stretch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Paul, a doubtful eye on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
sky. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t what you could call a real clear day,
girls, and I don&#8217;t want to take any chances with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not afraid, if you&#8217;re not,&#8221; sang out
Laura teasingly, and he turned round upon her
with a scowl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid for myself, and I think probably
you know that. Just the same&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but here&#8217;s the sun!&#8221; called Vi suddenly, as
the sun burst forth from the cloud and showered
a golden glory over everything. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be
a beautiful day&mdash;just beautiful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it was settled, and amid great fun and laughter
they picked up the lunch that Connie&#8217;s mother
prepared for them and started happily off, humming
as they went.
</p>
<p>As they clambered aboard <i>The Shelling</i>&mdash;Paul
had named his craft after Captain Shelling, the
master of Boxton Military Academy,&mdash;the sun went
under a cloud again, and this cloud was bigger and
blacker than any that had swallowed it before. But
Laura&#8217;s taunt still rang in Paul&#8217;s ears, and he said
nothing.
</p>
<p>In a little while there was no need for words.
The girls began to see for themselves that Paul
had been right and that it would have been far better
if they had waited till a really clear day.
</p>
<p>They had put some distance between them and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
the mainland when the sun went under a cloud for
good, and a cool little breeze began to rise.
</p>
<p>This had been going on for some time before
they even realized it, they were having such fun.
Then it was Connie who spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it look a little&mdash;a little&mdash;threatening,
Paul?&#8221; she asked timidly. &#8220;Do you suppose it is
going to rain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to rain,&#8221; Paul
answered, his hands on the wheel, his eyes rather
anxiously fixed on the water ahead. &#8220;But I do
think we&#8217;re going to have one of those sudden
heavy mists that come off the coast here. Dad said
to look out for them, because they&#8217;re thick enough
to cut, and if you get caught in one you can&#8217;t see
your hand before your face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls were sober enough now as they looked
at each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what makes you think we&#8217;re going to have
one, Paul?&#8221; asked Laura humbly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the air is so still and muggy,&#8221; Paul
answered, then added with a wave of his hand out
over the water: &#8220;Look&mdash;do you see that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8221; was a faint, misty cloudlike vapor hanging
so low that it seemed almost to touch the water.
And suddenly the girls were conscious that their
hair was wet and also their hands and their clothes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, we must be in it now!&#8221; said Vi looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
wonderingly down at her damp skirt. &#8220;Only
it&#8217;s so light you can&#8217;t see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it won&#8217;t be light very long,&#8221; said
Paul grimly, as he swung <i>The Shelling</i> around and
headed back the way they had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Laura, still
more humbly, for she now was beginning to think
that she was to blame for the fix they were in&mdash;if
indeed it were a fix.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get back to land as soon as I can,&#8221;
Paul answered her. &#8220;Before this fog closes down
on us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would happen, Paul?&#8221; asked Billie softly.
&#8220;I mean if it should close down on us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d be lost,&#8221; said Paul shortly, for by this
time he was more than anxious. He was worried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost!&#8221; they repeated, and looked at each other
wide-eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t look as if that was the end
of the world,&#8221; said Teddy, trying to speak lightly.
&#8220;All we would have to do would be to keep on
drifting around till the fog lifted. It&#8217;s simple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s simple all right,&#8221; said Chet gloomily.
&#8220;If we don&#8217;t run into anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run into anything!&#8221; gasped Connie, while the
other girls just stared. &#8220;Oh, Paul, is there really
any danger of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Paul impatiently, noticing that
the fog was growing thicker and blacker every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
moment. &#8220;There&#8217;s always danger of running into
something when you get yourself lost in a fog.
And it&#8217;s the little boat that gets the worst of it,&#8221;
he added gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, can&#8217;t you try being cheerful for a change?&#8221;
cried Teddy indignantly, for he had noticed how
white Billie was getting and was trying his best to
think of something to say that would make her
laugh. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use of singing a funeral song
yet, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and there&#8217;s no use in starting a dance,
either,&#8221; retorted Paul, wondering how much longer
he would be able to keep his course. &#8220;We&#8217;re in
a mighty bad fix, and no harm can be done by
everybody knowing it. I can&#8217;t possibly get back
to the island&mdash;or the mainland either&mdash;before this
fog settles down upon us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It took a minute or two for this to sink in. There
was no doubt about it. He was telling them that
in a few minutes they would be lost in this horrible
fog. And that might mean&mdash;they shivered and
turned dismayed faces to each other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;oh, I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; wailed Laura. &#8220;If
I hadn&#8217;t said what I did to Paul we might never
have come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! that had nothing to do with it,&#8221; said
Billie, putting a loyal arm about her chum. &#8220;We
would have come just the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then followed a waking nightmare for the boys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
and girls. In a few moments the fog settled down
upon them in a thick impenetrable veil, so dense
that, as Paul had said, you could almost have cut
it.
</p>
<p>It became impossible for Paul to steer, and all
there was to do was to sit still and wait and hope
for the best. Fog horns were sounding all about,
some seeming so close that the girls fully expected
to see some great shape loom up through the mist,
bearing down upon them.
</p>
<p>For a long time nobody spoke&mdash;they were too
busy listening to the weird meanings of the fog
horns and wondering how they could have escaped
a collision so long. For a while Paul had kept the
engine running in the hope that he might be able
to keep to his course and eventually get to Lighthouse
Island. But he had decided that this only
made a collision more likely, and so had shut it off.
And now they had been floating for what seemed
hours to the miserable boys and girls.
</p>
<p>It was Connie who finally broke the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she said, apropos of nothing at all,
&#8220;now I suppose we&#8217;ll have to die and never solve
our mystery after all.&#8221; She sighed plaintively, and
the girls had a wild desire to shout with laughter
and cry at the same time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness,&#8221; said Laura hysterically, &#8220;if we&#8217;ve
got to die who cares about mysteries anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys, who had been peering ahead into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
heavy unfriendly fog, looked at the girls in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;mystery?&#8221; Ferd asked.
</p>
<p>Before the girls could answer a sharp cry from
Paul jerked their eyes back to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he cried, one hand on the wheel and
the other pointing excitedly before them to a dark
something which loomed suddenly out of the mist.
&#8220;There! To starboard. We&#8217;ll bump it sure!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE BOYS ARE INTERESTED</h3>
</div>

<p>For a moment the girls were too terrified to
speak. And the next moment they could not have
spoken if they had wanted to, for <i>The Shelling</i>
collided so suddenly with whatever it was that had
risen out of the mist that they had all they could
do to keep from being thrown to the deck.
</p>
<p>Then Paul gave a cry of joy and sprang wildly
to the side of the boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, how&#8217;s this for luck, fellows?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;I thought it was another boat and that we were
bound for Davy Jones&#8217; locker sure, and here it&#8217;s
the dock instead. Say, talk about luck! I&#8217;ll say
it&#8217;s grand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dock!&#8221; the others echoed wonderingly. The
sudden relief was so great that they were feeling
rather dazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean it&#8217;s our dock&mdash;Lighthouse Island?&#8221;
Connie asked stupidly, and Paul&#8217;s answer was impatient.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it is&mdash;looks like it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But then
it doesn&#8217;t matter much what dock it is as long as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
it&#8217;s <i>a</i> dock. What do you people say to going
ashore?&#8221;
</p>
<p>What they said was soon shown by the eagerness
with which they scrambled on to the dock. And
when they found that it was really Lighthouse Island
dock their thankfulness was mixed with awe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a miracle!&#8221; said Vi, staring wide-eyed
about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just about what it looks like,&#8221; agreed
Chet soberly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A miracle!&#8221; exclaimed Ferd derisively. &#8220;It&#8217;s
just that the wind and the tide happened to be going
in the right way, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a miracle that the wind and the tide
did happen to be going the right way,&#8221; retorted
Laura.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it&#8217;s another miracle,&#8221; said Billie softly,
&#8220;that even with the wind and the tide going the
right way we didn&#8217;t run into something before we
got here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we did come pretty close to it,&#8221; said
Teddy soberly, staring out into the heavy mist that
still showed no sign of lifting. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
about the rest of you, but I do know that I&#8217;m
mighty glad to be on the good old ground again. It
beats the water, just now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; said Paul fervently, as he made his
boat fast to the dock. &#8220;It would have been a hot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
note if I&#8217;d had to lose my boat that way after working
all year to earn it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls and boys stared at him in surprise for
a moment. Then they laughed, and the laughter
broke the tension that they had been under and
made them feel more natural.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind us as long as you saved your boat,&#8221;
said Ferd with a chuckle. &#8220;Come on, folks. It&#8217;s
mighty damp out here. I&#8217;ll be glad when we can
get under cover and dry out a bit. Gee, but I&#8217;ll say
I&#8217;m some wet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mother will be just worried to death,&#8221;
cried Connie penitently, for this was the very first
minute she had given her mother a thought. &#8220;Oh,
let&#8217;s hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were starting off almost at a run when
Billie called to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know we forgot something?&#8221; she asked.
Then she pointed to the untouched lunch hamper
which Mrs. Danvers had heaped high with good
things. This was still standing close to the railing
on the deck of <i>The Shelling</i> where the boys had
put it when they climbed aboard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We forgot all about eating,&#8221; she said in an incredulous
voice. &#8220;Now I know we were scared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what do you know about that?&#8221; asked Ferd
weakly. &#8220;I&#8217;d have said it couldn&#8217;t be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it must be away
past lunch time, too,&#8221;
added Chet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, gosh! why did you go and remind me I
was starving?&#8221; groaned Teddy, and with a quick
movement he leaped into the boat and caught up
the basket. &#8220;Come on, who&#8217;s first?&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>But Billie stopped him by pressing a determined
hand down on the lid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not here,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;We&#8217;re all wet and uncomfortable,
and we&#8217;ll enjoy it ever so much more
if we wait till we get to the house. Please, Teddy,
now mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Teddy looked longingly at the basket, then at
Billie, and gave in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only we&#8217;ll have to walk
fast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they reached the cottage they found Connie&#8217;s
mother almost beside herself with anxiety and
Connie&#8217;s father doing his best to soothe her. So
that when the young folks came in the door looking
rather damp and bedraggled but safe, Mrs.
Danvers cried out joyfully, ran to them, and hugged
them one after another till she was completely and
rapturously out of breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You precious kiddies!&#8221; she cried, standing back
and regarding them with shining eyes. &#8220;You will
never know how horribly worried Dad and I have
been. You poor children, why, you are soaked
through! And,&#8221; as her eyes fell on the basket,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t mean to tell me you haven&#8217;t had any
lunch. Oh dear, oh dear! Run into the library, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
lot of you. Daddy made a fire thinking if we ever
did get you back you&#8217;d need some drying out&mdash;and
you can be starting in on sandwiches while I
make you some hot chocolate. Now run along&mdash;quick.&#8221;
And she disappeared into the kitchen while
the young folks went on into the library.
</p>
<p>Connie would have run after her mother to offer
her help, but Mr. Danvers stopped her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help Mother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You run along
with the others, dear, and get warmed through.
I don&#8217;t want my little girl to catch cold. It might
spoil your whole summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Connie went on into the library and found
that the boys had arranged the chairs in a semicircle
around the fire and were already opening the
lunch basket.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Danvers came in a few minutes later with
the chocolate, and, oh, how that hot drink did taste!
She demanded to know all about everything. They
told her, speaking one at a time, two at a time, and
all at once, till it was a wonder she could make
any sense out of it at all. But when she and her
husband did realize how terribly close the young
folks had been to disaster they looked very sober
and in their hearts thanked Providence for guiding
them back to safety.
</p>
<p>After they had eaten, the girls and boys felt very
lazy and lingered in the pretty library before the
open fire till the shadows began to fall.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we have half-way decent weather to start
out on to-morrow,&#8221; said Paul suddenly as he gazed
out of the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! must you go <i>to-morrow</i>?&#8221; asked Billie, with
such genuine regret that Teddy looked at her sideways.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8221; said Paul, also turning to look
at her. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a bully good time and we&#8217;d
like to stay longer, but you see I promised Dad
I&#8217;d pick him up a little farther along the coast and
I can&#8217;t do it unless we start to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose it isn&#8217;t a nice day?&#8221; Connie put in.
&#8220;Will you go anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, if it was really stormy we
couldn&#8217;t. We would have to wire Dad or something.
But I think it&#8217;s going to be clear to-morrow,&#8221;
he finished cheerfully.
</p>
<p>Connie shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Uncle
Tom says that a terribly heavy mist like this generally
forecasts a storm, and a pretty bad storm,
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t have to worry about that now,
anyway,&#8221; said Teddy, stretching his long legs out
contentedly toward the fire. &#8220;Let&#8217;s enjoy ourselves
while we can. By the way,&#8221; he added, turning to
Billie, and Billie thought that Teddy was getting
better looking every minute&mdash;or was it the firelight?
&#8220;What did you girls mean by speaking of a mystery?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
We haven&#8217;t heard a word about any mystery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you haven&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t suppose we
tell you <i>everything</i>, do you?&#8221; said Laura, with a
sisterly sniff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but what did you mean?&#8221; asked Ferd, adding
his voice to Teddy&#8217;s while the other boys seemed
interested.
</p>
<p>The girls looked at one another and then at
Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we tell them?&#8221; asked Vi.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Billie answered,
her eyes on the fire. &#8220;Of course we don&#8217;t know
that there&#8217;s any mystery about it. It only looks
queer, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then with the help of the girls she told the boys
all about the man who lived in a hut in the woods
and called himself Hugo Billings, and also about
Miss Arbuckle and the album she had been so overjoyed
to recover. The boys listened with an interest
that fast changed to excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should say there was something queer
about it!&#8221; Ferd Stowing broke out at last. &#8220;Especially
about the man who lives in the woods and
makes fern baskets. He&#8217;s either crazy or he&#8217;s a
thief or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, I wish you had told us about it while we
were there!&#8221; said Chet regretfully. &#8220;We might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
have been able to find out something&mdash;landed him
in jail maybe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; said Billie
promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Chet, amazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I felt awfully sorry for him,&#8221; his sister
answered softly. &#8220;And I&#8217;d rather help him than
hurt him. I&#8217;d like to see him smile again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smile?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for he looked so awfully downhearted.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE FURY OF THE STORM</h3>
</div>

<p>The next day the boys went off again in spite
of Mrs. Danvers&#8217; entreaties to stay another night
or two until the weather showed definite signs of
clearing up.
</p>
<p>But the boys were decided&mdash;saying that since the
mist had lifted they had really no excuse for staying
longer, and as Paul was evidently very anxious
to get to his father, Mrs. Danvers had nothing else
to do but to give in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, the fog has lifted,&#8221; she admitted,
gazing up anxiously at an overcast sky, &#8220;but after
a calm like this we are sure to have a storm&mdash;how
much of one it&#8217;s hard to tell. Well, go on. But
promise me to stay close to the mainland and to
put in to shore if the weather man looks too
threatening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys promised and the girls waved to them
until <i>The Shelling</i> was only a tiny speck on the
water. Then they turned rather sadly back toward
the Danvers&#8217; home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if somebody were dead or something,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
complained Vi, as they neared the bungalow. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the weather, I guess,&#8221; said Billie, feeling
low in spirits herself&mdash;a very unusual state for
merry Billie. &#8220;We shall all feel better when the
sun comes out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it ever does,&#8221; said Laura, gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to,&#8221; said Vi.
</p>
<p>Half way home they saw Uncle Tom hurrying
toward them with Robert Bruce at his heels, and
they wondered what the matter was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he cried when he came within earshot.
&#8220;I was just going to see your dad, Connie. The
boys haven&#8217;t gone yet, have they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And when Connie said that they had he looked
so grave that the girls were frightened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Uncle Tom, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked
Connie fearfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter enough,&#8221; said Uncle Tom, turning to
scowl up at the overcast sky. &#8220;It&#8217;s as much as
those youngsters&#8217; lives are worth for them to set
out to-day. Why, there&#8217;s a storm on the way,&#8221;
and he fixed his eyes gravely on the girls, &#8220;such
as this old Maine coast hasn&#8217;t seen for years. Why,
every captain who can read the signs is going to
make straight for the nearest port, or if he is too
far away to make port before the storm breaks, he&#8217;s
going to get down on his knees and pray the good
Lord to make his old ship staunch enough to stand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
the test. It will be upon us by night.&#8221; His eyes
sought the wild dreary waste of water and he spoke
as though to himself. &#8220;Lord, how I dread to-night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Uncle Tom, what can we do about the
boys?&#8221; Connie shook his arm fiercely. &#8220;Why, if
we have the kind of storm you say they may be
drowned! Oh, can&#8217;t we do something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Tom&#8217;s eyes came back from the horizon
and he shook his head slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s much we can do&mdash;now,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If they have any sense they&#8217;ll put
in to port before the storm breaks. That is if they
stick close in to shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They said they would,&#8221; Billie put in eagerly.
&#8220;Oh, I hope they do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uncle Tom nodded absently, for his mind seemed
to be upon other things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they ought to be all right,&#8221; he said, adding,
while the lines deepened about his mouth:
&#8220;But Heaven help the ships that can&#8217;t put into
shore to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned slowly and strode away from them
toward the lighthouse with Bruce still following
worshipfully after him. He had forgotten they
were there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Uncle Tom!&#8221; said Connie, as they went
slowly on toward the bungalow. &#8220;He always gets
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
so queer when there&#8217;s a storm along the coast. I
guess it makes him think of&mdash;her.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was night, and the storm had burst in all its
fury. The four girls and Connie&#8217;s mother had
gathered in the little front sitting room on the second
floor.
</p>
<p>Mr. Danvers had started a few minutes before
to press the button that would flood the room with
light, but Billie had begged him not to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see the light in the tower,&#8221; she had
pleaded, adding softly: &#8220;Somehow I&#8217;m not quite
so afraid for the ships out there when I see the
light. Oh, listen to that wind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we can very well help it,&#8221; said
Vi, with a little shiver and cuddling up close to
Billie on the window seat and slipping a hand into
hers. &#8220;Oh&mdash;h!&#8221; and she clapped her hand to her
ears as the wind rose to a wailing scream and the
windows all over the house shook and rattled with
the impact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Uncle Tom was right,&#8221; said Connie,
from somewhere out of the darkness. &#8220;Dad says,
too, that this is the worst summer storm we have
had around these parts for years. Oh, I do hope
the boys are safe somewhere on shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need worry about them,&#8221; said
Mr. Danvers. Or rather he started to say it, but
at that moment the wind rose with insane fury,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
bringing the rain with it in driving torrents that
beat swishingly upon the sand and drove viciously
against the windows.
</p>
<p>He waited for a moment until the wind died
down. Then he began again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The storm was a long time in coming,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The boys had plenty of warning. Paul is very
cautious, and I know he wouldn&#8217;t go on in the
face of such danger. But,&#8221; and he turned toward
the window again, &#8220;heaven help the ship that can&#8217;t
make port to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s almost exactly what Uncle Tom said,&#8221;
remarked Connie, and then there was silence in the
little room again while outside the storm raged and
the light from the lighthouse tower sent its warning
far out over the foam-crested waves.
</p>
<p>The girls went to bed at last. Not because they
expected to sleep, but because Connie&#8217;s mother insisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Uncle Tom!&#8221; murmured Billie to herself
as, in her little white nightie, she stood at the window
looking out toward the lighthouse tower. &#8220;All
alone out there. What was it he said? 'You think
of the men and the women and the little children
out there on the sinking ships, and you curse the
storm that&#8217;s bringing disaster along with it.' Poor,
poor Uncle Tom! I wonder if he <i>is</i> thinking of&mdash;her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>And with a sigh she turned from the window and
crept into bed beside Connie.
</p>
<p>Toward morning the girls were awakened from
an uneasy sleep by a strange white light flashed
suddenly in their eyes. They stumbled out of bed,
dazed by the suddenness with which they had been
awakened and stared out into the black night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; gasped Billie. &#8220;Oh my, there it
is again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The searchlight,&#8221; cried Connie, running over
to the window, her eyes wide with horror. &#8220;Billie,
that&#8217;s the signal to the life-savers. And there goes
the siren,&#8221; she groaned, clapping her hands over
her ears as the moan of the siren rose wailingly
into the night. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wreck! Billie&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A wreck!&#8221; cried a voice behind them, and they
turned to see Laura in the doorway with Vi peering
fearfully over her shoulder. &#8220;Oh, girls, I was
just dreaming&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what you were dreaming,&#8221; cried
Billie, beginning to pull on her clothes with trembling
hands. &#8220;If it is a wreck, girls, we may be
able to do something to help. Oh, where is my
other stocking? Did any one see it? Never mind,
here it is. Oh, hurry, girls; please, hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Twice more while they were dressing the searchlight
flashed round upon the island, filling their
rooms with that weird white light, and the siren
wailed incessantly its wild plea for help.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>The girls were just pulling on their waterproof
coats when Connie&#8217;s mother, white and trembling,
appeared in the doorway and stared with amazement
at sight of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you talking, girls,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and knew
you were awake. I hoped you would sleep through
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep through <i>that</i>?&#8221; asked Connie, as the siren
rose to a shriek and then died off into a despairing
moan. &#8220;Oh, Mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do, kiddies?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Danvers, taking a step toward them. &#8220;The
life-savers will be coming soon&mdash;perhaps they are
at work now&mdash;and they will do all that can be
done. Why are you putting on your coats?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, please don&#8217;t make us stay at home,&#8221;
begged Billie, turning an earnest, troubled face to
Connie&#8217;s mother. &#8220;We may not be able to do anything
to help, but we shall at least be there if we
should be needed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muddie, dear, we couldn&#8217;t stay here, we just
couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; added Connie, and with a little choked
cry Mrs. Danvers turned away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling, darling kiddies,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Run
along then if you must. Only,&#8221; she stopped at the
doorway to look earnestly back at them, &#8220;don&#8217;t go
any farther than the lighthouse until Dad and I
come. We&#8217;ll be along right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls ran down the stairs, and Connie opened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
the front door with hands that fumbled nervously
at the lock. As the door swung open the wind
sprang at them like a living thing, taking their
breath, making them stagger back into the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&mdash;that wind!&#8221; cried Laura, clenching her
hands angrily. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to kill it! Come on, girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laura rushed out into the storm while the other
girls followed, pulling the door shut behind them.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>FIGHTING FOR LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>Foot by foot they fought their way through the
storm, conscious that other hurrying forms passed
them from time to time. Their minds were fixed
upon one thing. They must get to Uncle Tom. He
would be able to tell them everything and perhaps
let them know how they could help.
</p>
<p>But they soon found that just getting to the lighthouse
was a problem. Time and again they had
to stop and turn their backs to the furious wind in
order to catch enough breath to fight their way on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; Connie had shouted once, pointing toward
the east. &#8220;It must be almost morning. The
sky is getting light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they hurried on they became more and more
conscious that everybody seemed to be heading in
the same direction&mdash;toward the lighthouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The shoal!&#8221; gasped Connie in Billie&#8217;s ear. &#8220;The
wind must have driven some ship upon it, and in
this gale&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she never finished the sentence, for at this
minute they came out upon the Point where the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
lighthouse stood and stopped dead at the scene
that met their eyes.
</p>
<p>The Point was black with people all gesticulating
and pointing excitedly out toward a great shape
which, looming grayly against the lifting blackness
of the sky, staggered and swayed like a drunken
thing in the grip of the gigantic foam-tipped waves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; moaned Connie, &#8220;it&#8217;s just as I thought!
There&#8217;s Uncle Tom. Come on, Billie.&#8221; And she
elbowed her way through the crowd to where Uncle
Tom stood, his great height making him conspicuous
among the other men, bawling out directions to
the life-savers who were just making ready to
launch their staunch little boats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, do you call this hurrying?&#8221; Uncle Tom
was crying, his eyes traveling from the life-savers
to the wreck and back again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see she&#8217;s
just hanging on by her eyelashes? Another sea like
that and you won&#8217;t have a chance to save anybody.
Good boys&mdash;that&#8217;s the idea. Bend your backs, my
lads. God help you&mdash;and them!&#8221; he added under
his breath, his eyes on the laboring vessel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom!&#8221; cried Connie, tugging at his arm,
&#8220;have they got a chance&mdash;those people out there?
Have they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He glanced down at her for a moment, then his
eyes sought the furious sea. He shook his head
and his hands clenched tight at his sides.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About one chance in a thousand,&#8221; he muttered,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
more to himself than to her. &#8220;The Evil One&#8217;s in
the sea to-night. I never saw the like of it&mdash;but
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then followed a struggle of human might against
the will of the overpowering elements&mdash;a struggle
that the girls never forgot. On, on, fought the
gallant men in the staunch little boats. On, on toward
the quivering giant that hung on the edge of
destruction&mdash;her fate the fate of all the lives on
board.
</p>
<p>The storm that had beaten her on to the treacherous
shoal was now doing its best to loosen her hold
upon it. And that hold was the one slender thread
that kept alive the hope of the passengers on board.
</p>
<p>If the pounding waves once succeeded in pushing
her back into the deeper water of the channel, nothing
could save her. The great hole ripped in her
side by the impact with the shoal would fill with
water, and in five minutes there would be nothing
left but the swirling water to mark the spot where
she had been.
</p>
<p>And the passengers! At the thought Billie cried
out aloud and clenched her fists.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, it can&#8217;t be, it can&#8217;t be! Those boats will
never reach her in time. Oh, isn&#8217;t there something
somebody can do?&#8221; She turned pleadingly to Uncle
Tom, but the look on his face startled her and she
followed his set gaze out to sea.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, there isn&#8217;t anything anybody can do&mdash;now,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>The storm had had its way at last. The elements
had won. With a rending of mighty timbers the
tortured ship slid backward off the shoal and into
the deep waters of the channel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There she goes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the last of that vessel!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if any of the folks on board got off
safely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see&mdash;the spray almost blinds a fellow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such were some of the remarks passed around
as the ship on the shoal slipped slowly from view.
</p>
<p>The girls clung to each other in an agony of
suspense. Never had they dreamed that they would
witness such a dreadful catastrophe as was now
unfolding before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billie, this is dreadful!&#8221; groaned Laura,
her face white with terror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly bear to look at it,&#8221; whimpered Vi.
&#8220;Just think of those poor people! I am sure every
one of them will be drowned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them must have gotten away in the
small boats,&#8221; answered Billie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any of the boats,&#8221; protested Connie.
&#8220;But, of course, you can&#8217;t see much of anything in
such a storm as this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All we can do is to hope for the best,&#8221; said Billie
soberly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the worst thing I ever heard of,&#8221; sighed
Vi. &#8220;Why must we have such storms as this to tear
such a big ship apart!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A groan went up from the watchers, and many
of them turned away. They could not see the end.
</p>
<p>But the girls stared, fascinated, too dazed by the
tragedy to turn their eyes away.
</p>
<p>The life-savers, who had almost reached the ship,
backed off a little, knowing that they could not help
the passengers now and fearful of being drawn
under by the suction themselves.
</p>
<p>The great ship hesitated a moment, trembled
convulsively through all her frame, then her stern
reared heavenward as though protesting against her
fate, and slowly, majestically, she sank from view
beneath the swirling waters.
</p>
<p>Then the girls did turn their eyes away, and
blindly, sobbingly, they stumbled back through the
crowd toward the lighthouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billie, Billie, they will all be drowned!&#8221;
sobbed Laura. The tears were running down her
face unchecked. &#8220;Oh, what shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they could only have held on just a few minutes
more,&#8221; said Vi, white-faced, &#8220;the life-savers
would then have had a chance to have taken them
off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They may save some of them anyway,&#8221; said
Billie, her voice sounding strange even to herself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
&#8220;The life-savers will pick up anybody who manages
to get free of the wreck, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but Uncle Tom says that when a ship sinks
like that it is hard to save anybody,&#8221; said Connie,
twisting her handkerchief into a damp little ball.
&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she said, turning upon them eyes that were
wide with horror, &#8220;it makes me crazy to think of
it. Out there, those people are drowning!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t&#8221; cried Billie, pressing her hands to her
ears. &#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t stand it. Girls, I&#8217;ve got to walk!&#8221;
And Billie started off almost at a run along the
beach, fighting her way against the wind.
</p>
<p>The other girls followed her, and for a while they
ran along, not knowing whither they were going,
or caring. All they wanted was to forget the horror
of the thing they had seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie stepped back so quickly that she almost
lost her footing in the slippery sand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Billie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&mdash;it looks like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s find out.&#8221; And Billie ran to
the thing that looked like a large piece of driftwood
washed up on the sand by the heavy sea.
</p>
<p>And as she reached it she drew in her breath
sharply and brushed a hand across her eyes to make
sure she was not dreaming. On the thing that was
not a piece of driftwood at all, but looked like a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
sort of crudely and hastily constructed raft, were
lashed three small, unconscious little forms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, look!&#8221; she almost screamed above the
shrill wind. &#8220;Do you see them, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, they are children!&#8221; cried Laura.
&#8220;Oh, Billie, do you suppose they&#8217;re alive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Billie, dropping to her knees
beside the three pitiful little figures. Two of them
were girls, twins evidently, and the third was a
smaller child, a boy. Something in their baby attitudes,
perhaps their very helplessness, stung Billie
to sudden action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me get them loose!&#8221; she cried to the other
girls, who were still staring stupidly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
whether they&#8217;re dead or not yet. But they will be if
we don&#8217;t hurry. Oh, girls, stop staring and help
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then how they worked! The slippery wet rope
that bound the little forms was knotted several
times, and the girls thought they must scream with
the nightmare of it before they got the last knot
undone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There! At last!&#8221; cried Billie, flinging the rope
aside and trying to lift one of the little girls. She
found it surprisingly easy, for the child was pitifully
thin. She staggered to her feet, holding the little
form tight to her.
</p>
<p>Laura and Vi each took one of the children and
Connie offered to help whoever gave out first. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
they started back to the lighthouse. Luckily for
them, the wind was at their backs, or they never
could have made the trip back.
</p>
<p>When they reached the Point they found that
most of the crowd had dispersed. Only a few
stragglers remained to talk over the tragedy in
awed and quiet whispers.
</p>
<p>These stared as the girls with their strange burdens
fought their way toward the door of the lighthouse.
Some even started forward as though to
offer assistance, but the girls did not notice them.
</p>
<p>Through the window Billie could see Uncle Tom
standing before his mantelpiece, head dropped
wearily on his arm. Then Connie opened the door
and they burst in upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Tom!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Please come
here, quick!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THREE SMALL SURVIVORS</h3>
</div>

<p>It did not take Uncle Tom very long, experienced
as he was, to bring the three children back to consciousness.
As it was, they had been more affected
by the cold and the fright than anything else, for
the raft, crude as it was, had kept them above the
surface of the waves and saved their lives.
</p>
<p>As the girls bent over them eagerly, helping Uncle
Tom as well as they could, the faint color came back
to the pinched little faces, and slowly the children
opened their eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they are alive, bless &#8217;em,&#8221; cried Billie, jumping
to her feet. But the quick action seemed to
terrify the children, and they cried out in alarm.
In a minute Billie was back on her knees beside
them, looking at them wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she asked, putting out
her hand to the little boy, who shrank away from
her and raised an arm before his eyes. &#8220;Why,
honey, did you really think Billie would hurt a nice
little boy like you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>But all three children had begun to cry, and Billie
looked helplessly at her chums.
</p>
<p>Uncle Tom had spread a large rug on the floor
and had laid the children on it while he worked over
them. Up to this time he had been on his knees
beside the girls, but now he got to his feet and
looked down at them soberly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been mistreating &#8217;em,&#8221; he said, his
eyes on the three cowering, pathetic little figures.
&#8220;Poor little mites&mdash;poor little mites! Found &#8217;em
on a sort of raft, you say? Washed up by the
waves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls nodded, and Billie, putting a tender arm
around the little fellow, succeeded in drawing him
up close to her while Laura and Vi tried to do the
same with the little girls. Connie was watching
her Uncle Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said the latter, stroking his chin thoughtfully.
&#8220;Folks on the ship probably&mdash;drowned out
there. Poor little waifs. Kind of up to us to take
care of &#8217;em, I reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; cried Connie, jumping to her
feet. &#8220;Uncle Tom, where did Mother and Daddy
go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On, toward the house,&#8221; said Uncle Tom, nodding
his head in the direction of the bungalow.
&#8220;When they couldn&#8217;t find you they got kind o&#8217;
worried and thought you must have made tracks
for home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come now,&#8221; cried Laura, for through
the windows she had caught sight of Mr. and Mrs.
Danvers hurrying along the walk toward the lighthouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Billie, hugging the little boy
to her and smoothing his damp hair back from his
forehead. The child had stopped crying and had
snuggled close to Billie, lying very still like a little
kitten who has found shelter and comfort in the
midst of a wilderness. The soft little confiding
warmth of him very suddenly made Billie want to
cry. &#8220;Your mother will know what to do,&#8221; she
said to Connie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always does,&#8221; said Connie confidently,
and a minute later opened the door to admit two
very much wind-blown, exhausted and very anxious
parents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, kiddies, what a fright you gave us!&#8221; cried
Connie&#8217;s mother, looking very pale and tired as she
leaned against the door post while Mr. Danvers
patted her hand gently and tried not to look too
much relieved. &#8220;Where did you go? Why,
girls&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stopped short in absolute amazement
and bewilderment as she caught sight of Laura and
Vi and Billie on the floor, each with a child clasped
in her arms. &#8220;Where did you get them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not wait for an answer. She flew across
the room and, dropping to her knees, gazed at the
children who at this new intrusion had started away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
from the girls and regarded her with wide, doubtful
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you precious little scared babies, you!&#8221;
she cried, pushing the girls away and gathering the
children to her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where you came
from, but what you need is mothering. Where did
they come from?&#8221; she asked, looking up at Uncle
Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From out there,&#8221; said Uncle Tom gravely, waving
his hand toward the spot where the ship had
gone down. Then he quickly told her and Mr. Danvers
what the girls had told him. They did not
interrupt. Only, when he had finished, Mrs. Danvers
was crying and not trying to hide it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, those poor, poor people!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;And
these poor little frightened, miserable children all,
all there is left. Oh, I&#8217;ll never get over the horror
of it. Never, never! John,&#8221; she added, looking up
at her husband with one of those quick changes of
mood that the girls had learned to expect in her,
&#8220;will you and Tom help me get the children home?
They mustn&#8217;t be left like this in dripping clothes.
They&#8217;ll catch their death of cold. What they need
is a hot bath and something to eat, and then bed.
Poor little sweethearts, they are just dropping for
sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Uncle Tom took one of the little girls, Mr.
Danvers another, and Connie&#8217;s mother insisted upon
carrying the little boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s nothing at all to carry,&#8221; she said,
when her husband protested. &#8220;Poor child&mdash;he&#8217;s only
skin and bones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the strange procession started for the bungalow,
the girls, tired out with nerve strain and excitement,
bringing up the rear. But they did not know
they were tired. The mystery of the three strange
little waifs washed up to them by the sea had done
a good deal to erase even the horror of the wreck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we haven&#8217;t the slightest idea in the world
who they really are or whom they belong to,&#8221; Connie
was saying as they turned in at the walk. &#8220;It is
a mystery, girls, a <i>real</i> mystery this time. And I
don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;ll solve it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But they forgot the mystery for the time being
in the pleasure of seeing the waifs bathed and
wrapped in warm things from the girls&#8217; wardrobes
and fed as only Connie&#8217;s mother could feed such
children.
</p>
<p>Gradually the fear died out of the children&#8217;s eyes,
and once the little boy even reached over timidly
and put a soft, warm hand in Billie&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling,&#8221; she choked, bending over to kiss
the little hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid of Billie now,
are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little girls, who were twins and as like as two
peas, were harder to win over. But by love and
tenderness Connie&#8217;s mother and the girls managed
it at last.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>And then eyes grew drowsy, tired little heads
nodded, and Connie&#8217;s mother, with a look at Mr.
Danvers, who had been hovering in the background
all the time, picked up one of the little girls and
started for the stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tuck them in bed,&#8221; she said, speaking
softly. &#8220;We can put them in our room, John&mdash;in
the big bed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the girls stood in Mrs. Danvers'
room, looking down at three little flushed
faces, three tousled heads that belonged to three
very sound-asleep little children.
</p>
<p>Connie&#8217;s mother tiptoed out of the room and
motioned to the girls to follow, but they lingered
for a minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they lovely?&#8221; asked Connie, with a catch
in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re beautiful,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;Especially the
little boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they ate,&#8221; said Vi softly, &#8220;as if they had
been half starved. Poor little things&mdash;I wonder
who they are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; said Billie gravely, &#8220;I suppose you will
laugh at me when I tell you, but ever since I first
saw them I have had a strange feeling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they said impatiently, as she paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I have seen them somewhere before,&#8221; she
finished, looking at them earnestly. &#8220;And now, as
they lie there I&#8217;m almost sure of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Seen them before?&#8221; repeated Connie, forgetting
in her astonishment to lower her voice, so that the
little boy stirred restlessly. Billie drew them out
into the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come into our room,&#8221; she said; and they followed
her in wondering silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would say that all over again, Billie,&#8221;
said Vi eagerly, when they had drawn their
chairs up close to Billie. &#8220;You said you had seen
them before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I said I thought I had seen them before,&#8221;
said Billie, frowning with the effort to remember.
&#8220;It seems foolish, I know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Billie, if you feel like that you must have
some reason for it,&#8221; said Laura eagerly.
</p>
<p>There followed a silence during which Billie
frowned some more and the girls watched her eagerly.
Then she disappointed them by suddenly jumping
up and starting for the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember now. Maybe
I will when I&#8217;ve stopped trying to. Come on, Connie,
let&#8217;s help your mother with the dishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Billie did not find the answer for several
days. Meanwhile they had received word from the
boys that they had put into port the afternoon of
the great storm and had not been able to go out
again until a couple of days later. No news concerning
the three waifs had come in.
</p>
<p>The boys had received news of the wrecked ship,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
of course, and were tremendously excited about it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls have all the luck, anyway,&#8221; Chet wrote
to Billie. &#8220;Just think&mdash;if we had stayed over a few
hours we would have seen the wreck too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billie tore the letter up and flung it into the paper
basket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck!&#8221; she had murmured, her face suddenly
grown white as she gazed out over the water that
was brilliantly peaceful once more in the afternoon
sunlight. &#8220;He calls <i>that</i> luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys had promised to return in a couple of
weeks and give the girls a regular &#8220;ride in the motor
boat.&#8221; If it had not been for the waifs who had
so strangely been entrusted to them, the girls would
have looked forward more eagerly to the return of
the boys.
</p>
<p>As it was, they were too busy taking care of the
sweet little girls and beautiful little boy and falling
in love with them to think much of the boys one
way or another except to be deeply thankful that
they had escaped disaster in the storm.
</p>
<p>And then, when Billie had nearly forgotten that
strange impression she had had in the beginning of
having seen the children before, suddenly she remembered.
</p>
<p>It was one night after the girls had gone to bed.
They had been laughing over some of the cunning
things the children had been doing, and Laura had
been wondering how they would go about finding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
the relatives of the children&mdash;if they had any&mdash;when
suddenly Billie sat up in bed with a look of
astonishment on her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I know where I saw those
children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, where?&#8221; they cried, and then held their
breath for her answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERY SOLVED</h3>
</div>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the two rooms
while the girls let this sink in. Then Laura and Vi
jumped out of bed, and, running into Connie&#8217;s
room, fairly pounced upon Billie.
</p>
<p>They were all so excited that for a moment they
could not speak. And then they all spoke at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie, you must be crazy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie, are you sure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>These, and a dozen other wild questions like them
fairly smothered poor Billie, and it was a long time
before she could get a word in edgewise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please keep still a minute,&#8221; she cried at last.
&#8220;You&#8217;re making so much noise you&#8217;ll wake the children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! who cares about the children?&#8221; cried
Laura impatiently. &#8220;Billie, if you don&#8217;t say something,
I&#8217;ll scream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, give me a chance then,&#8221; retorted Billie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did you mean by saying that you saw
them in Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s album?&#8221; asked Connie.
</p>
<p>Billie looked at her soberly and then said very
quietly. &#8220;Just that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Billie, when did this happen?&#8221; cried Laura,
fairly shaking her in her impatience. &#8220;For goodness
sake, tell us everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I know!&#8221; Vi broke in excitedly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you remember what Billie said about Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s
crying over the pictures of three children in
the album&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And said,&#8221; Connie took up the tale eagerly, &#8220;that
she had lost her dear ones, but didn&#8217;t want to lose
their pictures too? Oh, Billie, now it is a mystery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you are sure these are the same children
you saw in the album, Billie,&#8221; said Laura, walking
up and down the room excitedly, &#8220;you will have to
do something about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Billie, her eyes shining. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
write to Miss Arbuckle and tell her all about it.
Oh, girls, I can&#8217;t wait to see her face when she sees
them. I&#8217;m sure it will make her happy again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They talked about Billie&#8217;s remarkable discovery
late into the night, until finally sheer weariness
forced them to go to bed. But in the morning they
were up with the first ray of sunlight.
</p>
<p>They told Connie&#8217;s mother and father about it at
the breakfast table, and before they got through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
meal the two older people were almost as interested
and excited as the girls.
</p>
<p>As soon as she could get away Billie flew upstairs
to write her letter, leaving the others still at the
table. The children had already had their breakfast&mdash;for
like all children they woke up with the birds&mdash;and
were out playing on the front porch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I never heard anything like it!&#8221; said Connie&#8217;s
mother to her equally astonished husband. &#8220;It
seems like a fairy tale. But, oh, I do hope it is true&mdash;for
the kiddies&#8217; sake and for that of that poor
Miss Arbuckle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again and again Mrs. Danvers had tried to question
the children about their parents and where they
lived, but the little things had seemed to be thrown
into such terror at the very first questions and had
refused so absolutely to say a word that might lead
to the discovery of their relatives that she had been
forced to give up in despair. Just the very night
before Mr. Danvers had decided to go over to the
mainland and put an advertisement in all the leading
papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Although I rather dread to find their guardians,&#8221;
he had confided to his wife that night, as they had
stood looking down at the sweet little sleeping faces.
&#8220;I&#8217;m falling in love with them. It&#8217;s like having
Connie a baby all over again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Connie&#8217;s mother had patted his arm fondly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
and reached down to draw a cover up over one little
bare arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that way too,&#8221; she had said softly.
</p>
<p>When Billie had finished her letter Mr. Danvers
volunteered to take it over to the mainland for her
and send it special delivery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t put the ad in the paper then, will
you?&#8221; his wife asked as he started off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, stooping down to pat the little
boy&#8217;s dark head. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give Billie a chance to clear
up her mystery first.&#8221; And with a smile at Billie
he swung off down the walk while with quickened
hearts the girls and Mrs. Danvers watched him go.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the little fellow got up from the hollow
in the sand where he and his sisters had been making
sand pies and ran up to Billie, waving his shovel
excitedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Him goin&#8217; 'way?&#8221; he asked, pointing down the
beach toward Mr. Danvers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But he&#8217;s coming back,&#8221; said Billie, catching
the little fellow up and kissing his soft rosy
cheek. Then she looked at the girls and her eyes
filled with tears. &#8220;Oh, girls,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see how I&#8217;m going to give him up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then followed days of anxious waiting for the
girls. Every night when the mail came in on the
<i>Mary Ann</i> they were at the dock to meet it. But
though they searched for a letter postmarked Molata
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
with eager eyes, day after day went by and still
there was no word from Miss Arbuckle.
</p>
<p>This state of affairs continued for over a week
until the girls had begun to give up in despair. And
then one night it came&mdash;the letter they had been
waiting for.
</p>
<p>They did not wait to get home, but sat down on
the edge of the dock while Billie read it aloud.
</p>
<p>The letter was such a mixture of joy and hope
and fear that sometimes the girls had hard work
making anything out of it. However, this much
was clear: Miss Arbuckle intended to leave Molata
Friday night&mdash;and this was Friday night&mdash;and
would probably be at Lighthouse Island Saturday
morning. And to-morrow was Saturday!
</p>
<p>&#8220;She says,&#8221; Billie finished, her voice trembling
with excitement, &#8220;that the reason she didn&#8217;t write
to us before was because she was out of town and
didn&#8217;t receive my letter for almost a week after it
reached Three Towers Hall. She says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, who cares about that?&#8221; cried Laura impatiently.
&#8220;The main thing is that she will be here
to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a little over twelve hours to wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls did not sleep very well that night, and
they were up and dressed and at the dock almost an
hour before the steamer was due.
</p>
<p>They were so nervous that they could not stand
still, and it was just as well that the <i>Mary Ann</i> was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
a little early that morning, or the dock would have
been worn out completely, Connie declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billie, suppose she doesn&#8217;t come?&#8221; whispered
Vi as the boat slid into the dock. &#8220;Suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No suppose about it,&#8221; Billie whispered back joyfully.
&#8220;Look, Vi! There she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is the man with her?&#8221; cried Laura suddenly,
as Miss Arbuckle waved to them from the
upper deck and then started down the narrow winding
stairway, followed by a tall, rather stoop-shouldered
man who seemed to the girls to have something
vaguely familiar about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not be with her,&#8221; Billie answered. But
suddenly she gasped. Miss Arbuckle had stepped
upon the dock with hands outstretched to the girls,
and as the tall man followed her Billie got her first
full look at his face.
</p>
<p>It was Hugo Billings, the mysterious maker of
fern baskets whom they had found in his hut in
the woods!
</p>
<p>As for the man, he seemed as much astonished
as the girls, and he stood staring at them and they
at him while Miss Arbuckle looked from one to
the other in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Hugo, have
you met the girls before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, why yes,&#8221; stammered the man, a smile
touching his lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see we were lost in the woods and he very
kindly showed us the way out,&#8221; said Billie, finding
her voice at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Miss Arbuckle.
</p>
<p>Then she introduced her companion to the girls
as &#8220;my brother&#8221; and once more the girls thought
they must be losing their minds. But this time
Miss Arbuckle did not seem to notice their bewilderment,
for her whole mind was on the object that had
brought her here.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The children?&#8221; she asked, her voice trembling
with emotion. &#8220;Are they here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are at my house, Miss Arbuckle,&#8221; said
Connie, recovering from her bewilderment enough
to realize that she was the hostess. &#8220;I suppose
you&#8217;re crazy to see them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes! Oh yes!&#8221; cried the teacher. Then, as
Connie led the way on toward the cottage, she
turned to Billie eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;are you sure you recognized
my children? If I should be disappointed now
I&mdash;I think it would kill me. Tell me, what do they
look like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Billie described the waifs Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s
face grew brighter and brighter and the man whom
the girls had called Hugo Billings leaned forward
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s no mistake this time, Mary,&#8221; he
said, and there was infinite relief in his tone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>When they reached the cottage the children were
playing in the sand as usual, and the girls drew
back, leaving Miss Arbuckle and her brother to go
on alone.
</p>
<p>Miss Arbuckle had grown very white, and she
reached out a hand to her brother for support. Then
she leaned forward and called very softly: &#8220;Davy,
Davy, dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The children stopped playing and stared up at
the visitors. But it was the little fellow who recognized
them first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary! My Mary!&#8221; he cried in his baby voice,
and ran as fast as his little legs could carry him
straight into Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s arms. Then the little
girls ran to her, and Miss Arbuckle dropped down
in the sand and hugged them and kissed them and
cried over them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my children! My darling, darling children!&#8221;
she cried over and over again, while the man stood
looking down at them with such a look of utter
happiness on his face that the girls turned away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; whispered Billie, and they slipped
past the two and into the house.
</p>
<p>Connie&#8217;s mother and father were in the library,
and when the girls told them what had happened
they hurried out to greet the newcomers, leaving
the chums alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Laura, sinking down on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
couch and looking up at them, &#8220;what do you think
of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so dazed, I don&#8217;t know what to think of it,&#8221;
said Billie, adding, with a funny little laugh: &#8220;The
only thing we do know is that everybody&#8217;s happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk about mysteries&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Connie was beginning
when Connie&#8217;s mother and Miss Arbuckle came
in with the clamoring, excited children. And to say
that Miss Arbuckle&#8217;s face was radiant would not
have been describing it at all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh girls, girls!&#8221; she cried, looking around at
them, while her eyes filled with tears, &#8220;do you know
what you&#8217;ve done for me&mdash;do you? But of course
you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she answered herself, sitting down on
the couch while the children climbed up and
snuggled against her. &#8220;And that&#8217;s what I want to
tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ob, but not now,&#8221; protested Connie&#8217;s mother.
&#8220;I want to get you a cup of tea first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please let me tell the girls now. I want
to,&#8221; begged Miss Arbuckle, and Connie&#8217;s mother
gave in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; the teacher began while the girls
gathered around eagerly, &#8220;only a few months ago
Hugo&mdash;my brother&mdash;and I were very happy. That
was before the dreadful thing happened that
changed everything for us. I was nurse and governess,&#8221;
she hugged the children to her and they
gazed up at her fondly, &#8220;to these children at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
same house where Hugo was head gardener. Our
employers were very wealthy people, and, having
too many social duties to care for their children,
Hugo and I sort of took the place of their father
and mother. Indeed we loved them as if they belonged
to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused a moment, and the girls stirred impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the terrible thing happened,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;One night the children disappeared. I
had put them to bed as usual, and in the morning
when I went in to them they were gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that wasn&#8217;t enough&mdash;Hugo and I weren&#8217;t
sorrow-stricken enough,&#8221; she went on, a trace of
bitterness creeping into her voice. &#8220;But they&mdash;Mr.
and Mrs. Beltz&mdash;must accuse us&mdash;us&mdash;of a plot
to kidnap the children. They accused us openly,
and Hugo and I, being afraid they had enough circumstantial
evidence to convict us, innocent though
we were, fled from the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about all,&#8221; she said, with a sigh. &#8220;Hugo
built himself a little refuge in the woods and made
fern baskets, selling enough to make him a scanty
living, and I went as a teacher and house matron
to Three Towers Hall. That is why,&#8221; she turned
to Billie, who was staring at her fascinated, &#8220;I was
so desperate when I lost the album, and why,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
added, with a smile, &#8220;I acted so foolishly when you
returned it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t foolish,&#8221; said Billie. &#8220;I think you
were awfully brave. I understand everything now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t&mdash;not quite,&#8221; put in Connie&#8217;s mother,
her pretty forehead puckered thoughtfully. &#8220;Of
course you didn&#8217;t kidnap the children,&#8221; turning to
Miss Arbuckle, &#8220;but it is equally certain that somebody
must have done it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; Connie broke in eagerly.
&#8220;The kidnappers, whoever they were, must have
gone down on the ship out there on the shoal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And they bound the children on that funny raft
and set them adrift, probably thinking they would
be able to get away themselves,&#8221; added Vi eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then the ship went down before they could
follow,&#8221; said Billie, adding, as she turned earnestly
to the teacher: &#8220;Oh, Miss Arbuckle, it was awful&mdash;that
poor ship out there going down with all the
people on board!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it must have been horrible. I read about
it in the papers,&#8221; nodded Miss Arbuckle soberly.
Then a great light broke over her face as she looked
down at the three children who were still not much
more than babies. &#8220;But some good comes of almost
everything. I have my precious children now, and
I can take them back to their family and prove my
innocence&mdash;and Hugo&#8217;s. Oh I&#8217;m so happy&mdash;I&#8217;m
so happy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t you come back to Three Towers any
more?&#8221; asked Laura, her face so long that Miss
Arbuckle laughed delightedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear,&#8221; she said, a joyful light in her
eyes that made her quite a different person. &#8220;Hugo
will probably go back to his old position, but I&mdash;oh,
I could not desert Three Towers now after all you
girls have done for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Connie&#8217;s mother had her way and whisked
joyful Miss Arbuckle away upstairs to &#8220;take off her
hat&#8221; while the children trailed after, leaving the
girls alone.
</p>
<p>Laura and Connie and Vi fairly hugged each
other over the marvelous clearing up of their mystery,
but Billie turned away and looked out of the
window, while sudden tears stung her eyes.
</p>
<p>She did not notice that the little boy whom Miss
Arbuckle had called Davy stopped at the foot of the
stairs and crept softly back to her, she did not know
he was anywhere around, till a soft little hand was
slipped into hers and a baby voice said plaintively:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me loves my Billie, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling!&#8221; cried Billie, kneeling down and
catching him close to her. &#8220;I suppose they will
take you away now where you belong, honey, but
don&#8217;t ever forget your Billie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And when the girls went over to her a few minutes
later they were surprised to find that her eyes
were wet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Billie, you&#8217;ve been crying!&#8221; Laura exclaimed.
&#8220;And you ought to be as happy as the
rest of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Billie, wiping her eyes hard. &#8220;Only
I was thinking of little Davy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t, if it makes you cry and gets your
nose all red,&#8221; scolded Connie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, honey,&#8221; said Vi, putting an arm
about her. &#8220;We are all sorry to see the kiddies go,
of course. But we can see them again some time
if we want to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And just think,&#8221; added Laura happily, &#8220;the boys
are coming back next week. And that means Teddy,
too,&#8221; she added slyly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m glad he&mdash;<i>they</i> are coming,&#8221; stammered
Billie, and the others laughed at her confusion.
Then suddenly she wiped away the last trace of
her tears and her eyes began to shine, making her
look like the Billie the girls knew and loved best.
&#8220;We <i>will</i> have some good times when the boys come,
girls. Why,&#8221; as if making a surprising discovery,
&#8220;our fun has just begun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And that Billie was speaking the truth and that
there were more adventures in store for the boys
and girls than even the girls dreamed of on that
beautiful summer day, will be shown in the next
volume of the series.
</p>
<p>In the due course of time the three Beltz children
were restored to their parents. It was learned that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
they had been kidnapped by three men who had
thought to make a large sum of money out of their
scoundrelly game. But all three kidnappers had
lost their lives in the wreck.
</p>
<p>At first it was supposed that many had gone down
in the foundering of the <i>Daniel Boley</i>, as the ship
was named. But later on it was learned that three
small boats had got away in safety and the survivors
had been picked up by a vessel bound for
Halifax. So the loss of life was, after all, small.
</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Beltz were heartily ashamed of
having suspected Miss Arbuckle and her brother of
wrong doing, and they offered both their positions
back at increased salaries. Hugo returned to the
Beltz estate, but not so his sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the children very, very much,&#8221; said Miss
Arbuckle. &#8220;But I also love Three Towers Hall and
the girls there. I shall remain at the school.&#8221; And
she did, much to the delight of Billie and her chums.
</p>
<p>And now the sun shining brightly once more and
happiness all around them, let us say good-bye to
Billie and the other girls on Lighthouse Island.

<p><i>This new series of girls&#8217; books is in a new
style of story writing. The interest is in knowing
the girls and seeing them solve the problems
that develop their character. Incidentally, a
great deal of historical information is imparted.</i>
</p>
<p>1. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE MYSTERY HOUSE
</p>
<p><i>or The Story of Nine Adventurous Girls</i>
</p>
<p>How the Linger-Not girls met and formed
their club seems commonplace, but this
writer makes it fascinating, and how they
made their club serve a great purpose continues
the interest to the end, and introduces
a new type of girlhood.
</p>
<p>2. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE VALLEY FEUD
</p>
<p><i>or The Great West Point Chain</i>
</p>
<p>The Linger-Not girls had no thought of becoming mixed up with
feuds or mysteries, but their habit of being useful soon entangled
them in some surprising adventures that turned out happily for all,
and made the valley better because of their visit.
</p>
<p>3. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THEIR GOLDEN QUEST
</p>
<p><i>or The Log of the Ocean Monarch</i>
</p>
<p>For a club of girls to become involved in a mystery leading back
into the times of the California gold-rush, seems unnatural until the
reader sees how it happened, and how the girls helped one of their
friends to come into her rightful name and inheritance, forms a fine
story.
</p>
<p>4. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE WHISPERING CHARMS
</p>
<p><i>or The Secret from Old Alaska</i>
</p>
<p>Whether engrossed in thrilling adventures in the Far North or
occupied with quiet home duties, the Linger-Not girls could work
unitedly to solve a colorful mystery in a way that interpreted
American freedom to a sad young stranger, and brought happiness
to her and to themselves.

</p>
<p>RUBY AND RUTHY

<p>Ruby and Ruthie were not old enough to

that taught many useful lessons needed to
be learned by little girls.
</p>
<p>RUBY'S UPS AND DOWNS
</p>

<p>Ruby had many surprises when she went to the impossible place
she heard called a boarding school, but every experience helped
to make her a stronger-minded girl.
</p>
<p>RUBY'S VACATION

<p>This volume shows how a little girl improves by having varieties
of experience both happy and unhappy, provided she thinks,
and is able to use her good sense. Ruby lives and learns.
